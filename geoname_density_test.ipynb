For example, patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by a silencing of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene, exhibit impairments in visual function specific to the dorsal system, which processes motion information. However, the developmental and circuit mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Recently, the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure regulating head and eye movements, has emerged as a model for dissecting visual circuit development and function. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for activity-dependent processes in the development of visual circuitry in the SC. Based on the known role of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene product in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, we explored the function and organization of visual circuits in the SC of a mouse model of FXS (<italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id=\"Par2\">We utilized in vivo extracellular electrophysiology in combination with computer-controlled visual stimuli to determine the receptive field properties of visual neurons in the SC of control and <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice. In addition, we utilized anatomical tracing methods to assess the organization of visual inputs to the SC and along the retinogeniculocortical pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id=\"Par3\">Receptive fields of visual neurons in the SC of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice were significantly larger than those found in control animals, though their shape and structure were unaffected. Further, selectivity for direction of movement was decreased, while selectivity to axis of movement was unchanged. Interestingly, axis-selective (AS) neurons exhibited a specific hyperexcitability in comparison to AS neurons in control SC and to direction-selective (DS) neurons in both control and <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> SC. Anatomical tracings revealed that retinocollicular, retinogeniculate, and geniculocortical projections were normally organized in the absence of <italic>Fmr1</italic>. However, projections from primary visual cortex (V1) to the SC were poorly refined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id=\"Par4\"><italic>Fmr1</italic> is required for the proper development of visual circuit organization and function in the SC. We find that visual dysfunction is heterogeneously manifested in a subcircuit-specific manner in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice, consistent with previous studies in human FXS patients. Further, we show a specific alteration of inputs to the SC from V1, but not the retina. Together, these data suggest that <italic>Fmr1</italic> may function in distinct ways during the development of different visual subcircuits.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang=\"en\"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Receptive field</kwd><kwd>Direction selective</kwd><kwd>Axis selective</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>NIH</institution></funding-source><award-id>R01EY025267</award-id><award-id>U54HD090257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Triplett</surname><given-names>Jason W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Brain and Behavior Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>NARSAD YIA 21259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Triplett</surname><given-names>Jason W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>RG 2013-08-41</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Triplett</surname><given-names>Jason W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id=\"Sec1\"><title>Background</title><p id=\"Par18\">Sensory processing disorders occur frequently in the pediatric population, affecting as many as 1 in 20 children at some point in their development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. The prevalence of sensory dysfunction is even higher among those with a neurodevelopmental disorder, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>] and fragile X syndrome (FXS) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>]. Since sensory deficits may amplify symptoms and interfere with therapies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>], they present an attractive target for intervention that may have a broad and multiplicative impact. However, while sensory dysfunction is a hallmark feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders, there is a gap in our understanding of the underlying circuit-level causes.</p><p id=\"Par19\">FXS, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, is the most common hereditable form of intellectual disability and the most prevalent single gene cause of ASD. It is caused by the silencing of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene, resulting in reduced expression of the gene product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein. In the brain, FMRP is a critical player in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, and thus circuit formation and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>]. Patients with FXS exhibit a wide range of sensory dysfunctions that manifest in multiple modalities, including vision, audition, and somatosensation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. In the visual domain, patients show impaired magnocellular pathway function, which processes information about stimulus movement, while visual form detection is unaffected [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>]. Interestingly, function in this visual domain is also altered in <italic>FMR1</italic> premutation carriers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>] and may be correlated with the level of FMRP expression in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. Despite this, little is known about how loss of FMRP expression affects the function of visual neurons in the brain.</p><p id=\"Par20\">In recent years, the mouse superior colliculus (SC) has emerged as an attractive model to understand sensory circuit development, organization, and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. The SC processes visual, somatosensory and auditory information to regulate goal-directed head and eye movements [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>]. Of these modalities in the SC, the development of visual circuitry is most&#x000a0;well understood and relies on a combination of molecular cues, axon-axon competition, and activity-dependent processes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In addition, our understanding of visual function and circuit wiring in the SC has advanced substantially due to clever application of advanced genetic, electrophysiological, imaging, and viral tracing techniques [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>].</p><p id=\"Par21\">Based on the critical role of FMRP in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and the dependence of visual circuit development in the SC on activity-dependent processes, we tested the hypothesis that visual circuit function and organization in the SC requires FMRP expression. To do so, we determined the receptive field properties of visual neurons in the SC of a mouse model of FXS in which the <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene is knocked out (<italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>]. We show that visual receptive fields are increased in size, but retain normal shape and substructure. Further, we found that selectivity for direction of movement is decreased in the SC of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice, but neurons tuned to the movement of oriented bars along their orthogonal axes are unchanged. Interestingly, axis-selective (AS) neurons were hyperexcitable, despite retaining their tuning properties. We also found that the terminal areas of inputs to the SC from the primary visual cortex (V1) are enlarged in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockouts, while those from the retina are unaffected. Together, these data suggest that FMRP is required for the proper development of visual circuit organization and function in the SC and, further, that FMRP may function in distinct ways during the development of different visual subcircuits.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Methods</title><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>Mice</title><p id=\"Par22\"><italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice were generated and genotyped as previously described [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>].

Only male mice were used for both experimental and control animals to avoid potential mosaicism associated with heterozygous females and to facilitate the use of littermates as controls.

Briefly, adult male mice (postnatal day 60 (P60)&#x02013;P120) were anesthetized with isofluorane. The animal&#x02019;s temperature was monitored and maintained at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C through a feedback-controlled heating pad. Silicone oil was applied on the eyes to prevent drying.

A 16-channel silicone probe (Neuronexus) coated in DiI was lowered between 0.8 and 1.5&#x000a0;mm into the SC at a 35&#x000b0; angle and stabilized with agarose (1% in PBS).

The monitor (52&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;29.5&#x000a0;cm, 60-Hz refresh rate) was placed 22&#x000a0;cm from the animal in front of the eye contralateral to the recording penetration, subtending ~&#x02009;90&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;70&#x000b0;&#x000a0;of visual space. We utilized a flashing spot stimulus in which a white square subtending 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5&#x000b0; of visual space was displayed for 500&#x000a0;ms at pseudorandom locations for five trials at each location. Following presentation, the screen remained blank for 500&#x000a0;ms before the next stimulus presentation. Thus, individual trials could be divided into two sub-stimuli to isolate the ON and OFF responses of each cell. Spontaneous firing was determined during additional blank stimuli, and the threshold was set as the mean spontaneous rate plus two standard deviations. The ON and OFF responses were determined by counting the number of spikes occurring in a 200-ms window starting at 50&#x000a0;ms after spot onset and offset, respectively. The total responses were determined using the spikes occurring in both the ON and OFF windows. A cell was considered responsive to either or both stimuli if the spike rate exceeded threshold in at least 40% of trials. Since we did not assume that receptive fields would be shaped such that they could be fit with a 2-D Gaussian, receptive field area was calculated as the number of squares to which an individual unit responded, as described previously [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. The length of azimuth (<italic>L</italic><sub>A</sub>) and elevation (<italic>L</italic><sub>E</sub>) axes, calculated as the number of squares eliciting a response along the horizontal and vertical axes of the receptive field, respectively, was used to calculate the axes ratio (<italic>L</italic><sub>A</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>E</sub>).

A temporal frequency of 2&#x000a0;Hz was consistent for all the gratings. Each stimulus of given orientation and spatial frequency (or a blank condition) was presented for 1.5&#x000a0;s in a pseudorandom order for five trials, with an interstimulus interval of 0.5&#x000a0;s.

We next wondered if the anatomical organization of visual inputs to the SC might be disrupted in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice.

Further, layer V neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) terminate such that they are in topographic alignment with RGC inputs that monitor the same region of space. To begin to determine if <italic>Fmr1</italic> expression is required for proper targeting of visual inputs to the SC, we focally labeled small regions of the retina with the lipophillic tracer, DiI, which allows for visualization of the termination zones (TZs) of labeled RGC axons in the SC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig7\" ref-type=\"fig\">7a</xref>).

To test this possibility, we examined the anatomical organization of projections along the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway. We first examined RGC projections to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) by DiI tracing in adult mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">8a</xref>). Similar to our findings for retinocollicular projections, we found that TZs in the dLGN appeared similar in both <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> and <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">8b</xref>, <xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">c</xref>). In fact, we observed no difference in TZ size, measured as a percent of the dLGN, between groups (<italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup>: 3.283&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5857, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 mice; <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup>: 4.067&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8487, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 mice; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5635, K-S test) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">8d</xref>). To further investigate the organization of retinogeniculate projections, we assessed eye-specific segregation in the dLGN. To do so, we bulk-labeled RGCs by injecting fluorescently tagged cholera toxin subunit b of different colors (CTb-488 or CTb-555) in each eye and visualizing their terminals in the dLGN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">8e</xref>). Using this technique, we found that eye-specific segregation in the dLGN of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice appeared similar to that of controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">8f</xref>, <xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">g</xref>). Quantification of the overlapped pixels as a percent of the size of the ipsilateral patch confirmed this, as we found no difference between groups (<italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup>: 10.21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.792, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 mice; <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup>: 10.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6233, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 mice; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9952, K-S test) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">8h</xref>). Finally, we assessed geniculocortical projection organization by focally injecting CTb-555 into V1 to retrogradely label neurons in the dLGN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">8i</xref>). Imaging of the origination zone (OZ) of labeled neurons revealed a similarly sized and shaped region in the dLGN of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> and <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">8j</xref>, <xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">k</xref>). Quantification of OZ size also revealed no significant difference between groups (<italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup>: 16.31&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8233, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 mice; <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup>: 16.47&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2582, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 mice; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4286, K-S test) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig8\" ref-type=\"fig\">8l</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the mature anatomical organization of projections along the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway are grossly normal in the absence of <italic>Fmr1</italic>. Combined with our retino- and corticocollicular tracing data, as well as our receptive field mapping, these data suggest that disruptions in V1 corticocollicular circuit formation may underlie deficits in visual function in the SC of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice.<fig id=\"Fig8\"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Topography of retinogeniculocortical pathway is preserved in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of tracing paradigm to assess retinogeniculate topography. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> Coronal sections through the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN, dashed area) reveal the termination zones (TZs) of focally labeled retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> (<bold>b</bold>) and <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> (<bold>c</bold>) mice. <bold>d</bold> Quantification of the TZ size as a percent of the dLGN. <bold>e</bold> Schematic of tracing paradigm to assess eye-specific segregation in the dLGN. <bold>f</bold>, <bold>g</bold> Coronal sections through the dLGN (dashed area) reveal the terminations of bulk-labeled RGCs projecting from the contralateral (red) and ipsilateral (green) eye of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> (<bold>f</bold>) and <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> (<bold>g</bold>) mice. <bold>h</bold> Quantification of the amount of overlap between ipsilateral and contralateral inputs in the dLGN, measured as a percent of the ipsilateral patch. <bold>i</bold> Schematic of tracing paradigm to assess geniculocortical topography. <bold>j</bold>, <bold>k</bold> Coronal sections through the dLGN (dashed area) reveal the origination zone (OZ) of geniculocortical neurons labeled in primary visual cortex of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> (<bold>l</bold>) and <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> (<bold>g</bold>) mice. <bold>h</bold> Quantification of the OZ size as a percent of the dLGN.

While psychophysical data suggests visual deficits in patients with FXS, as well as premutation carriers, a circuit-level understanding of visual dysfunction is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that visual circuit function and organization in a critical midbrain nucleus are disrupted in a mouse model of FXS. Specifically, visual neurons in the SC of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice exhibit enlarged receptive field areas and reduced direction selectivity. In addition, we found that AS neurons specifically are hyperexcitable in the absence of FMRP, though their tuning properties are unaffected. Interestingly, our axon tracing data reveal that inputs to the SC from V1, but not the retina, are disrupted, having larger TZs than those found in control animals. Overall, these data argue that deficits in visual processing and development of connectivity are subcircuit specific and thus suggest that FMRP may perform distinct functions in the assembly of different circuits. Further, elucidation of these deficits in the SC, a nucleus critically involved in the generation of goal-directed eye movements, opens the possibility for future investigations of the SC as a novel therapeutic target in FXS.</p><sec id=\"Sec17\"><title>A novel role for FMRP in visual circuit formation in the SC</title><p id=\"Par39\">The development of properly organized receptive fields in the SC is likely due to a combination of molecular cues and activity-dependent forces that guide RGCs to the appropriate post-synaptic partners in the SC. Indeed, mutant mice lacking ephrin-A molecules involved in map formation exhibit misshapen receptive fields in the SC [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. And, in mouse mutants in which the normal pattern of spontaneous retinal activity is disrupted (&#x003b2;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), the receptive fields of neurons in the SC are increased and expanded along the azimuth axis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. Our findings in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice are similar to these data, suggesting a role for FMRP in the activity-dependent formation of retinocollicular connectivity. Interestingly; however, we did not observe a disruption in retinocollicular topography, which is evident in &#x003b2;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>], suggesting that the normal pattern of spontaneous retinal waves remain intact in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice and that FMRP is not required for wave-dependent RGC axon terminal refinement and pruning. We did find that V1 corticocollicular projections were disrupted and potentially misaligned with the retinal map. Based on our previous work suggesting visual map alignment is dependent on cholinergic retinal waves [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>], these data suggest that FMRP may play a specific role in wave-driven refinement of V1-SC corticocollicular arbors, but not in wave-driven refinement of RGC terminals.</p><p id=\"Par40\">Previous studies suggest that both RGCs and V1 corticocollicular neurons establish connections with common post-synaptic targets in the SC [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref>], so it is unclear why retinocollicular refinement is unaffected in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice, but the refinement of V1-SC terminals is disrupted. Such specificity could be due to the regulation of FMRP expression temporally or spatially during development. Retinocollicular mapping occurs during the first postnatal week, while alignment of corticocollicular projections occurs in the second postnatal week [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. Thus, FMRP expression in the SC could be temporally regulated: not expressed in the SC&#x02014;and, thus, not required&#x02014;during retinocollicular refinement, but expressed during V1-SC corticocollicular refinement to play a critical role in this process. Alternatively, FMRP expression could be restricted spatially, which could result in the differential effects of its loss on retinocollicular and corticocollicular refinement. That is, FMRP could be specifically expressed by V1 neurons projecting to the SC, but not in RGCs, during development. While there is evidence for FMRP expression in adult SC and retina [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>], a better understanding of the developmental timing of FMRP expression is needed in order to begin testing these possibilities.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec18\"><title>Altered direction selectivity in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice</title><p id=\"Par41\">The nature of visual dysfunction in patients with FXS has been described as being specific to the magnocellular pathway [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>], which in part processes information about object location and movement [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>]. Intriguingly, we observed associated circuit-specific deficits in the SC of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice, in that direction selectivity is reduced and receptive field size is increased, which combined could reduce the ability to localize objects and detect their movement. Interestingly, however, while we found a decrease in DSI, this was not reflected in a significant change in the proportion of DS neurons in the SC of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the remaining DS neurons are less selective, which could arise if DS neurons became more responsive to movement opposite to their preferred orientation. Another possibility is that this parameter of tuning is decreased in non-selective or AS neurons, perhaps due to the elevated basal and evoked firing rates we report here.</p><p id=\"Par42\">Our data suggest a reduction in direction selectivity in the SC of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice, but the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. Recent studies in the mouse SC using distinct methodologies suggest that direction selectivity is inherited from DS RGCs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. While our tracing data suggest that retinal projections to the SC are grossly normal, it remains possible that the specific connectivity patterns of DS RGCs are disrupted. Alternatively, the tuning and selectivity of DS RGCs could be affected, which is in turn relayed to SC neurons. Another possibility is that loss of FMRP expression results in a loss of DS neurons in the retina. Recent work suggests multiple changes in retinal function and synaptic protein expression; however, effects were primarily limited to the outer retina [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. Future studies leveraging molecular markers of particular subtypes of RGCs and SC neurons are needed to determine if changes in tuning or loss of any specific cell type occurs in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec19\"><title>FMRP regulates the excitability, but not tuning, of axis-selective neurons</title><p id=\"Par43\">In many neurodevelopmental disorders, including FXS, alterations in excitatory-inhibitory balance have been reported in multiple circuits [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>]. Intriguingly, we found that in the SC, alterations in excitability were restricted to AS neurons, while DS neurons and ON/OFF neurons in knockout SC showed similar spontaneous and evoked firing rates in comparison to controls. This subcircuit-specific change supports the hypothesis that FMRP performs distinct functions in a circuit-specific manner. But how might such a change occur? One possibility is an alteration in the number or strength of GABAergic inputs to AS neurons in the SC. In support of this, inhibitory neurons are densely packed into the SC [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>] and the GABAergic transmission is dramatically altered in <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. Alternatively, the disrupted organization and, presumably, connectivity of V1 corticocollicular neurons in the SC could underlie the increase in firing rate. Interestingly, the spontaneous rate of neurons in the SC was increased in a previous study in which the cortex was removed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>], supporting this possible mechanism. Optogenetic and/or chemogenetic manipulation of corticocollicular inputs or local inhibitory neurons are needed to further test these possibilities.</p><p id=\"Par44\">Surprisingly, we found that despite the increased excitability of AS neurons in the SC of <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/y</italic></sup> mice, the tuning properties&#x02014;such as preferred directions, spatial frequency preference, and sharpness of tuning&#x02014;of these neurons was spared. Thus, within the SC, FMRP may regulate the gain of AS neuron firing rate, which is separable from the selectivity. Interestingly, the tuning and gain of response are also separable for neurons in the SC that are tuned to a looming stimulus [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]. In that study, activation of V1 reduced the gain of looming neurons, but other aspects of tuning, such as preferred speed, were unaffected. These findings are consistent with our data, in that we found a disorganization of V1 corticocollicular projections. Thus, a primary function of V1-SC inputs may be to modulate the gain of multiple, but not all, SC subcircuits. It would be interesting to test this hypothesis directly using optogenetic techniques.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec20\"><title>Conclusions</title><p id=\"Par45\">Here, we demonstrate different deficits in distinct visual subcircuits in the SC of a mouse model of FXS.

'\\n\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nSensory processing disorders occur frequently in the pediatric population, affecting as many as 1 in 20 children at some point in their development [1, 2]. The prevalence of sensory dysfunction is even higher among those with a neurodevelopmental disorder, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [3] and fragile X syndrome (FXS) [4]. Since sensory deficits may amplify symptoms and interfere with therapies [5], they present an attractive target for intervention that may have a broad and multiplicative impact. However, while sensory dysfunction is a hallmark feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders, there is a gap in our understanding of the underlying circuit-level causes.\\n\\nFXS, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, is the most common hereditable form of intellectual disability and the most prevalent single gene cause of ASD. It is caused by the silencing of the FMR1 gene, resulting in reduced expression of the gene product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein. In the brain, FMRP is a critical player in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, and thus circuit formation and function [6]. Patients with FXS exhibit a wide range of sensory dysfunctions that manifest in multiple modalities, including vision, audition, and somatosensation [7]. In the visual domain, patients show impaired magnocellular pathway function, which processes information about stimulus movement, while visual form detection is unaffected [8]. Interestingly, function in this visual domain is also altered in FMR1 premutation carriers [9] and may be correlated with the level of FMRP expression in healthy individuals [10]. Despite this, little is known about how loss of FMRP expression affects the function of visual neurons in the brain.\\n\\nIn recent years, the mouse superior colliculus (SC) has emerged as an attractive model to understand sensory circuit development, organization, and function [11]. The SC processes visual, somatosensory and auditory information to regulate goal-directed head and eye movements [12]. Of these modalities in the SC, the development of visual circuitry is most\\xa0well understood and relies on a combination of molecular cues, axon-axon competition, and activity-dependent processes [13]. In addition, our understanding of visual function and circuit wiring in the SC has advanced substantially due to clever application of advanced genetic, electrophysiological, imaging, and viral tracing techniques [14–18].\\n\\nBased on the critical role of FMRP in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and the dependence of visual circuit development in the SC on activity-dependent processes, we tested the hypothesis that visual circuit function and organization in the SC requires FMRP expression. To do so, we determined the receptive field properties of visual neurons in the SC of a mouse model of FXS in which the Fmr1 gene is knocked out (Fmr1−/y) [19]. We show that visual receptive fields are increased in size, but retain normal shape and substructure. Further, we found that selectivity for direction of movement is decreased in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice, but neurons tuned to the movement of oriented bars along their orthogonal axes are unchanged. Interestingly, axis-selective (AS) neurons were hyperexcitable, despite retaining their tuning properties. We also found that the terminal areas of inputs to the SC from the primary visual cortex (V1) are enlarged in Fmr1 knockouts, while those from the retina are unaffected. Together, these data suggest that FMRP is required for the proper development of visual circuit organization and function in the SC and, further, that FMRP may function in distinct ways during the development of different visual subcircuits.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\n\\nMice\\n\\n\\nFmr1 knockout mice were generated and genotyped as previously described [19]. Mice were back-crossed for at least five generations and maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Only male mice were used for both experimental and control animals to avoid potential mosaicism associated with heterozygous females and to facilitate the use of littermates as controls. Mice were housed in a temperature and humidity-controlled room under standard 12/12-h light-dark cycle. After weaning, mice were housed in groups of 1–5 with same-sex siblings. All procedures were performed in accordance with, and approved by, the Children’s National Health System IACUC.\\n\\n\\nIn vivo electrophysiology\\n\\nRecordings were performed as previously described [17]. Briefly, adult male mice (postnatal day 60 (P60)–P120) were anesthetized with isofluorane. The animal’s temperature was monitored and maintained at 37\\xa0°C through a feedback-controlled heating pad. Silicone oil was applied on the eyes to prevent drying. A craniotomy was performed on the right hemisphere ~\\u20090.5\\xa0mm lateral from the midline suture and between 1.5 to −\\u20090.25\\xa0mm anterior from the lambda suture. A 16-channel silicone probe (Neuronexus) coated in DiI was lowered between 0.8 and 1.5\\xa0mm into the SC at a 35° angle and stabilized with agarose (1% in PBS). Electrical signals were amplified and filtered between 0.7 and 7\\xa0kHz, sampled at 25\\xa0kHz, and acquired using a System 3 workstation (Tucker-Davis Technologies). Individual units were identified by spike sorting methods using independent component analysis, as described previously [20].\\n\\n\\nVisual stimuli and receptive field determination\\n\\nVisual stimuli were generated using custom software (MATLAB), as described previously [20]. The monitor (52\\u2009×\\u200929.5\\xa0cm, 60-Hz refresh rate) was placed 22\\xa0cm from the animal in front of the eye contralateral to the recording penetration, subtending ~\\u200990\\u2009×\\u200970°\\xa0of visual space. We utilized a flashing spot stimulus in which a white square subtending 5\\u2009×\\u20095° of visual space was displayed for 500\\xa0ms at pseudorandom locations for five trials at each location. Following presentation, the screen remained blank for 500\\xa0ms before the next stimulus presentation. Thus, individual trials could be divided into two sub-stimuli to isolate the ON and OFF responses of each cell. Spontaneous firing was determined during additional blank stimuli, and the threshold was set as the mean spontaneous rate plus two standard deviations. The ON and OFF responses were determined by counting the number of spikes occurring in a 200-ms window starting at 50\\xa0ms after spot onset and offset, respectively. The total responses were determined using the spikes occurring in both the ON and OFF windows. A cell was considered responsive to either or both stimuli if the spike rate exceeded threshold in at least 40% of trials. Since we did not assume that receptive fields would be shaped such that they could be fit with a 2-D Gaussian, receptive field area was calculated as the number of squares to which an individual unit responded, as described previously [21]. The length of azimuth (LA) and elevation (LE) axes, calculated as the number of squares eliciting a response along the horizontal and vertical axes of the receptive field, respectively, was used to calculate the axes ratio (LA/LE). Area ratio was calculated using ON and OFF subfield areas (AON/AOFF). The overlap index measures the degree of overlap between the ON and OFF subfields while taking into account the distance between their centers. It is calculated using the equation: OI\\u2009=\\u2009(W1\\u2009+\\u2009W2\\u2009−\\u2009c)/(W1\\u2009+\\u2009W2\\u2009+\\u2009c), where W1 and W2 are the half-widths of the subfields measured along the line joining the subfield centers, and c is the distance between the ON and OFF subfield centers [14]. The response ratio was calculated with the peak ON and OFF responses (Ron,max /Roff,max).\\n\\nTo calculate directional and axial tuning, drifting gratings of 100% contrast at 12 different orientations (30° spacing) and six different spatial frequencies between 0.01 and 0.32\\xa0cpd (six logarithmic steps) were presented. A temporal frequency of 2\\xa0Hz was consistent for all the gratings. Each stimulus of given orientation and spatial frequency (or a blank condition) was presented for 1.5\\xa0s in a pseudorandom order for five trials, with an interstimulus interval of 0.5\\xa0s. The preferred direction (θpref) and preferred spatial frequency were determined as those at which the mean response was greatest. Selectivity was described using two indices: (1) direction selectivity index (DSI)\\u2009=\\u2009(Rpref\\u2009−\\u2009Ropp)/(Rpref\\u2009+\\u2009Ropp), where Rpref was the response at θpref and Ropp at θpref\\u2009+\\u2009π and (2) axis selectivity index (ASI)\\u2009=\\u2009(Rpref\\u2009−\\u2009mean(Rorth))/(Rpref\\u2009+\\u2009mean(Rorth)). The tuning curves were fitted with a sum of two Gaussians centered at θpref and θpref\\u2009+\\u2009π using the nlinfit function in MATLAB, and the tuning width was calculated as the half-width at half-maximum of the fitted curve above the baseline [20]. A cell was considered direction selective (DS) with a DSI greater than 0.33 and an OSI greater than 0.33. A cell was considered axis selective (AS) with an OSI greater than 0.33 and a DSI less than 0.33.\\n\\n\\nAxon tracing\\n\\nFocal and bulk labeling of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was performed as described previously [22]. Briefly, adult mice (>\\u2009P40) were deeply anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of ketamine/xylazine solution (100/10\\xa0mg/kg) and the eye elevated out of the orbital socket by applying gentle pressure to the head. For focal labeling, a small amount (~\\u200950\\xa0nL) of 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI, ThermoFisher) (10% in dimethylformamide (DMF)) was pressure injected into the nasal or temporal regions of the retina using a pulled glass pipet attached to a Picospritzer III (Parker-Hannafin). For bulk labeling, ~\\u2009500\\xa0nL of fluorescently conjugated cholera toxin subunit b (CTb-488 or CTb-555, ThermoFisher) (2\\xa0mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) was pressure injected into the posterior eye chamber using a pulled glass pipet and Picospritzer III.\\n\\nFocal labeling of V1 neurons for anterograde tracing to the SC and retrograde tracing to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) was performed as previously described [23]. Briefly, adult mice were deeply anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of ketamine/xylazine solution (100/10\\xa0mg/kg). For anterograde labeling of V1-SC projections, a focal craniotomy was made over V1 using a 25\\xa0ga needle, and ~\\u200950\\xa0nL of DiI was pressure injected with a pulled glass pipet attached to a Picospritzer III. For retrograde labeling of geniculocortical projections, anesthetized mice were head fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus with ear bars. A focal craniotomy was made over V1 with an Ideal Micro Drill (Stoelting) and a Hamilton syringe with 33 ga needle attached was lowered ~\\u2009400\\xa0μm into the neuropil. Using a Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector (Stoelting), 100\\xa0μL of CTb-555 (10\\xa0mg/mL) was injected at a rate of 0.5\\xa0mL/min.\\n\\n\\nTissue processing and microscopy\\n\\nImmediately after in vivo recording or 1\\xa0week following tracer injection, mice were euthanized and intracardially perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains and eyes were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight or 30\\xa0min, respectively. For retinal DiI injections, the brains were briefly washed in PBS and the contralateral cortical hemisphere was removed and the underlying SC was imaged in whole mount. The brains were then embedded in 2% agarose and 150-μm sections were cut in the coronal plane with a Manual Slice Vibratome (World Precision Instruments) in order to image the dLGN. In addition, the retinas were dissected, flat mounted, and imaged to verify DiI injection site size and location. For other injections, the brains were briefly washed in PBS, embedded in 2% agarose and 150-μm sections were cut in the coronal (bulk retinal labeling, CTb in V1) or sagittal (DiI in V1) plane. All imaging was performed on a BX61 microscope equipped with an AxioCam HR digital camera (Olympus).\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nAll values are reported as mean\\u2009±\\u2009SEM. The distributions of all data were first tested for normality of distribution using the D’Agostino & Pearson normality test. Normally distributed data were compared using the Student’s t test, while other distributions were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) or the median ranks were compared using a Mann-Whitney test. For comparison of baseline and peak firing rates of the same neuron, a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used. All statistical tests were evaluated at α\\u2009=\\u20095% probability of false positives. All analyses were performed with the statistical software package Prism (GraphPad).\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nVisual receptive field size and shape\\n\\nTo determine the receptive field properties of visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice, we recorded extracellular signals from the SC of isofluorane anesthetized mice while presenting computer-controlled visual stimuli. To begin, we presented mice with a flashing spot stimulus in which a white square occupying 5\\u2009×\\u20095° of visual space was shown on gray background in a pseudorandom order (Fig.\\xa01a). Individual units were identified post hoc and spikes associated with each unit were correlated with the stimulus presentation. Consistent with previous studies [14, 24], receptive field structures in the SC of Fmr1+/y control mice were roughly circular in shape, with the most robust responses elicited by stimuli in the center of the receptive field (Fig.\\xa01e & f). We found that receptive fields of visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice were qualitatively similar in structure to those of controls, though they appeared larger (Fig.\\xa01e & f). Indeed, the mean area of receptive fields in Fmr1−/y mice was significantly increased compared to those found in control mice (Fmr1+/y: 425.00\\u2009±\\u200950.13\\xa0deg2, n\\u2009=\\u200917\\xa0units from 1 to 3 penetrations each in 9 mice; Fmr1−/y: 566.30\\u2009±\\u200933.49\\xa0deg2, n\\u2009=\\u200931\\xa0units from 1 to 4 penetrations each in 11 mice; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0197, unpaired t test) (Fig.\\xa01g). Interestingly, quantification of the extent of visual space monitored along the horizontal (azimuth) and vertical (elevation) axes suggested that the shape of receptive fields was slightly changed in knockouts, as we observed a significant increase in the mean length of the azimuth axis (Fmr1+/y: 22.59\\u2009±\\u20091.39°; Fmr1−/y: 26.49\\u2009±\\u20090.81°; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0124, unpaired t test), but this was not observed for the elevation axis (Fmr1+/y: 23.09\\u2009±\\u20091.54°; Fmr1−/y: 26.28\\u2009±\\u20091.16°; p\\u2009=\\u20090.1059, unpaired t test) (Fig.\\xa01h). However, we observed no change in the average ratio of azimuth to elevation axes (Fmr1+/y: 0.9863\\u2009±\\u20090.01236; Fmr1−/y: 1.0340\\u2009±\\u20090.02557; p\\u2009=\\u20090.4576, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa01f), suggesting that the shape of receptive fields were roughly the same for neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice, despite the increase in size.\\n\\nFig. 1 Enlarged receptive field size of visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice. a Schematic of in vivo visual stimulus presentation set up and flashing spot paradigm. b Schematic of the silicon multi-electrode array utilized. c Representative parasagittal section through the SC from a mouse in which recording was performed.

For g–j, individual values for each identified neuron are shown, and the bar indicates the mean\\n\\n\\nON and OFF subfield size, shape, and organization\\n\\nMost neurons in the SC respond to both the onset and offset of light presented anywhere in their receptive field. To determine if there were specific changes in either the ON or OFF subfield of visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice, we segregated spikes into bins containing those occurring when the square was present (ON) and those occurring when the square had disappeared (OFF) from a given location (Fig.\\xa01a). Consistent with previous data [14, 24], we found that most cells identified in the SC of both Fmr1+/y and Fmr1−/y mice had quantifiable ON and OFF subfields that were roughly circular in shape (Fig.\\xa02a–d). Interestingly, we found that the mean area of the OFF subfield was significantly increased in the knockout group (Fmr1+/y: 404.1\\u2009±\\u200946.24\\xa0deg2; Fmr1−/y: 576.0\\u2009±\\u200930.16\\xa0deg2; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0023, unpaired t test), while the mean area of the ON subfield was unchanged (Fmr1+/y: 448.3\\u2009±\\u200956.02\\xa0deg2; Fmr1−/y: 573.4\\u2009±\\u200948.27\\xa0deg2; p\\u2009=\\u20090.1127, unpaired t test) (Fig.\\xa02e). However, this was not reflected in a change the ON to OFF subfield area ratio (Fmr1+/y: 1.092\\u2009±\\u20090.05394 arbitrary units (A.U.); Fmr1−/y: 1.018\\u2009±\\u20090.07387 A.U.; p\\u2009=\\u20090.4972, unpaired t test) (Fig.\\xa02f). Similarly, we observed no difference in the degree of overlap between ON and OFF subfields (Fmr1+/y: 0.603\\u2009±\\u20090.05394 A.U.; Fmr1−/y: 0.641\\u2009±\\u20090.03346 A.U.; p\\u2009=\\u20090.5364, unpaired t test) (Fig.\\xa01g). Further, we observed no change in the ratio of the ON to OFF response rate (Fmr1+/y: 1.007\\u2009±\\u20090.02449 A.U.; Fmr1−/y: 0.919\\u2009±\\u20090.09185 A.U.; p\\u2009=\\u20090.4950, unpaired t test) (Fig.\\xa02h). Together, these data suggest that the increased receptive field size of visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice may reflect a specific increase in the OFF subfield size, but that the general structure of receptive fields is not altered in the absence of Fmr1.\\n\\nFig. 2 Enlarged OFF, but not ON, subfield of visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice. a–d Heat maps of the isolated ON (a and c) and OFF (b and d) responses to the flashing spot stimulus from the representative neurons identified in the SC of Fmr1+/y (a and b) and Fmr1−/y (c and d) mice. e Quantification of the average ON and OFF receptive field (RF) area. **p\\u2009<\\u20090.01, unpaired t test. f Quantification of the ON to OFF area ratio. g Quantification of the ratio of ON and OFF subfield overlap. h Quantification of the average evoked firing rate in the ON and OFF subfields. i Quantification of the ON to OFF subfield response ratio.

We presented square waves moving in 12 different orientations and at 6 different spatial frequencies. To begin, we calculated the axis- and direction selectivity indices (ASI, DSI), which measure the response rate at the preferred orientation compared to the orthogonal (ASI) or opposing (DSI) orientation. While we found no difference in the cumulative distribution of ASIs between groups (Fmr1+/y: 0.385\\u2009±\\u20090.02681, n\\u2009=\\u200980; Fmr1−/y: 0.369\\u2009±\\u20090.02716, n\\u2009=\\u200982; p\\u2009=\\u20090.2032, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa03b), there was a significant shift in the cumulative distribution of DSIs for visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice towards less selectivity (Fmr1+/y: 0.2613\\u2009±\\u20090.02864; Fmr1−/y: 0.1559\\u2009±\\u20090.02017; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0004, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa03c). By plotting the DSI as a function of ASI for each identified neuron, we were able to visualize the proportion of DS and AS neurons (Fig.\\xa03d, e). Neurons classified as DS fall into the upper right corner of this plot, surpassing our threshold of 0.33 for both ASI and DSI; neurons classified as AS fall into the bottom right of this plot, surpassing a threshold of 0.33 for ASI, but falling below this for DSI. Using these criteria, we found no change in the overall number of neurons selective for some aspect of the drifting square wave stimulus (Fmr1+/y: 50.0%; Fmr1−/y: 52.3%), but we did observe a slight shift in the proportions of AS and DS neurons (Fmr1+/y: DS\\u2009=\\u200922.5%, AS\\u2009=\\u200927.5%; Fmr1−/y: DS\\u2009=\\u200917.1%, AS\\u2009=\\u200935.4%) (Fig.\\xa03f, g); however, this change was not significantly different (Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed p\\u2009=\\u20090.2676). Together, these data suggest that visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice are less selective for direction of movement, but the proportion of DS neurons is not altered.\\n\\nFig. 3 Decreased direction selectivity of visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice. a Schematic of drifting square wave visual stimulus paradigm. b Representative raw traces from recordings in the SC of Fmr1+/y (black) and Fmr1−/y (red) mice in response to the stimulus presented in a. c, d Quantification of the axis (c) and direction (d) selectivity indices (ASI, DSI) for all neurons identified in response to the drifting square wave stimulus.

Representative examples of the tuning curves of DS neurons from Fmr1+/y and Fmr1−/y SC are shown in Fig.\\xa04a, b, which appear grossly similar. Consistent with this, we found no difference in the proportions of DS neurons exhibiting preference for different directions of movement (p\\u2009=\\u20090.4375, K-S test) nor different spatial frequencies (p\\u2009=\\u20090.9810, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa04c, d), suggesting that tuning diversity of DS neurons is still intact in the absence of Fmr1. Additionally, the sharpness of tuning, measured by the average tuning width of DS neurons was unchanged (Fmr1+/y: 27.90\\u2009±\\u20093.575°, n\\u2009=\\u200918; Fmr1−/y: 28.68\\u2009±\\u20092.622°, n\\u2009=\\u200914; p\\u2009=\\u20090.8682, unpaired t test) (Fig.\\xa04e). Finally, while we observed a significant difference in the peak firing rate compared to the baseline rate for DS neurons in both the Fmr1+/y and Fmr1−/y groups (Fmr1+/y: baseline = 2.283\\u2009±\\u20090.6782, peak = 9.833\\u2009±\\u20092.123, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test; Fmr1−/y: baseline = 2.6\\u2009±\\u20090.8846, peak = 9.994\\u2009±\\u20091.784, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test), there was no difference between either across groups (baseline, p\\u2009=\\u20090.3590, Mann-Whitney; peak, p\\u2009=\\u20090.6158, Mann-Whitney) (Fig.\\xa04f). Together, these data suggest that despite an overall reduction in selectivity for direction of movement in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice, the existing DS neurons are normally tuned.\\n\\nFig. 4 Properties of direction-selective neurons in the SC are unchanged in Fmr1−/y mice. a, b Polar plots of representative direction-selective (DS) neurons in the SC of Fmr1+/y (a) and Fmr1−/y (b) mice.

Similar to what we found for DS neurons, we observed no change in the proportionality of AS neurons exhibiting preference for different axes of movement (p\\u2009=\\u20090.7591, K-S test) nor spatial frequencies (p\\u2009=\\u20090.9995, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa05c, d). Additionally, we found no difference between groups in the cumulative distribution tuning widths for AS neurons (Fmr1+/y: 35.41\\u2009±\\u20093.439°, n\\u2009=\\u200922; Fmr1−/y: 43.85\\u2009±\\u20093.563°, n\\u2009=\\u200929; p\\u2009=\\u20090.3438, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa05e), suggesting that the sharpness of tuning is similar between groups. As we observed for DS neurons, the peak rate of firing was significantly increased compared to the baseline rate for AS neurons in the SC of both Fmr1+/y and Fmr1−/y mice (Fmr1+/y: baseline = 5.776\\u2009±\\u20091.155, peak = 15.26\\u2009±\\u20092.677, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test; Fmr1−/y: baseline = 14.63\\u2009±\\u20093.229, peak = 29.01\\u2009±\\u20094.047, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test) (Fig.\\xa05f). Intriguingly, we observed a significant increase in both the median baseline and median peak firing rate of AS neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice compared to AS neurons in control SC (baseline: p\\u2009=\\u20090.0271, Mann-Whitney; peak: p\\u2009=\\u20090.0063, Mann-Whitney) (Fig.\\xa05f). Taken together, these data suggest that while the tuning properties of AS neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice are not substantially changed, they exhibit hyperexcitability compared to AS neurons in control SC.\\n\\nFig. 5 Increased baseline and peak firing rate of axis-selective neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice. a, b Polar plots of representative axis-selective (AS) neurons in the SC of Fmr1+/y (a) and Fmr1−/y (b) mice.

To do so, we compared the baseline and peak firing rates of DS and AS neurons in both control and Fmr1−/y mice. In Fmr1+/y mice, we found no difference in either the baseline or peak firing rates of DS and AS neurons (baseline: p\\u2009=\\u20090.1259, K-S test; peak: p\\u2009=\\u20090.2005, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa06a, b). In contrast, we found that both the baseline and peak firing rates of AS neurons were significantly higher than those of DS neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice (baseline: p\\u2009=\\u20090.0034, K-S test; peak: p\\u2009=\\u20090.0036, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa06a, b). Notably, the average baseline and peak rates of AS neurons were 5.6-fold and 2.9-fold greater than those of DS neurons, respectively. Together, these data suggest that in the absence of Fmr1, there is an AS circuit-specific increase in excitability of AS neurons, which is observed in both the spontaneous rate and visually evoked response.\\n\\nFig. 6 Comparison of baseline and peak firing rates of direction- and axis-selective neurons in the SC. a, b Quantification of the baseline (A) and peak (B) firing rates of direction-selective (light gray) and axis-selective (dark-gray) neurons in the SC of Fmr1+/y and Fmr1−/y mice. **p\\u2009<\\u20090.01, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\\n\\n\\nOrganization of visual inputs to the SC\\n\\nThus far, our in vivo electrophysiological data suggests that in Fmr1−/y mice visual neurons in the SC have larger receptive fields, reduced direction selectivity, and alterations in the excitability of AS neurons. We next wondered if the anatomical organization of visual inputs to the SC might be disrupted in Fmr1−/y mice. The SC receives visual inputs from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye, as well as layer V neurons in visual cortical areas [11]. Each of these projections is organized topographically, such that neighbor-neighbor relationships of cell bodies are recapitulated in their axon terminals in the target. Further, layer V neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) terminate such that they are in topographic alignment with RGC inputs that monitor the same region of space. To begin to determine if Fmr1 expression is required for proper targeting of visual inputs to the SC, we focally labeled small regions of the retina with the lipophillic tracer, DiI, which allows for visualization of the termination zones (TZs) of labeled RGC axons in the SC (Fig.\\xa07a). Interestingly, we found that the TZs of retinal inputs in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice were strikingly similar to those observed in control mice (Fig.\\xa07b, c). Indeed, we found no difference in TZ size, measured as a percent of the SC, between groups (Fmr1+/y: 1.912\\u2009±\\u20090.286, n\\u2009=\\u20095 mice; Fmr1−/y: 1.796\\u2009±\\u20090.3715, n\\u2009=\\u20097 mice; p\\u2009=\\u20090.5455, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa07d). We then traced projections from the primary visual cortex (V1) to the SC by focally injecting DiI into the cortices of adult mice and visualized TZs in sagittal sections (Fig.\\xa07e). We found that V1-SC TZs in Fmr1−/y mice were localized to the correct sublamina; however, they appeared larger than those found in control mice (Fig.\\xa07f, g). Indeed, we found a significant increase in the TZ size, measured as a percent of the SC, in Fmr1−/y mice (Fmr1+/y: 12.38\\u2009±\\u20091.206, n\\u2009=\\u20098 mice; Fmr1−/y: 17.33\\u2009±\\u20091.019, n\\u2009=\\u200910 mice; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0207, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa07h). Together, these data demonstrate that retinal inputs to the SC appear unaffected in the absence of Fmr1, but that the refinement of cortical V1 inputs may be disrupted, indicating a possible misalignment with the retinal map.\\n\\nFig. 7 Altered corticocollicular topography in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice. a Schematic of tracing paradigm to assess retinocollicular topography. b, c Whole mount images of the SC (dashed area) reveal the termination zones (TZs) of focally labeled retinal ganglion cells in Fmr1+/y (b) and Fmr1−/y (c) mice. d Quantification of the TZ size as a percent of the SC. e Schematic of tracing paradigm to assess corticocollicular topography. f, g Parasagittal sections through the SCs (dashed area) of Fmr1+/y (f) and Fmr1−/y (g) mice reveal the TZ of Layer 5 neurons labeled in the visual cortex. h Quantification of the TZ size as a percent of the SC. For d and h, individual values for each identified neuron are shown, and the bar indicates the mean. *p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\\n\\nOne potential explanation for the alteration in V1 inputs to the SC could be that they simply reflect topographic disorganization in the cortex. To test this possibility, we examined the anatomical organization of projections along the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway. We first examined RGC projections to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) by DiI tracing in adult mice (Fig.\\xa08a). Similar to our findings for retinocollicular projections, we found that TZs in the dLGN appeared similar in both Fmr1+/y and Fmr1−/y mice (Fig.\\xa08b, c). In fact, we observed no difference in TZ size, measured as a percent of the dLGN, between groups (Fmr1+/y: 3.283\\u2009±\\u20090.5857, n\\u2009=\\u20094 mice; Fmr1−/y: 4.067\\u2009±\\u20090.8487, n\\u2009=\\u20095 mice; p\\u2009=\\u20090.5635, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa08d). To further investigate the organization of retinogeniculate projections, we assessed eye-specific segregation in the dLGN. To do so, we bulk-labeled RGCs by injecting fluorescently tagged cholera toxin subunit b of different colors (CTb-488 or CTb-555) in each eye and visualizing their terminals in the dLGN (Fig.\\xa08e). Using this technique, we found that eye-specific segregation in the dLGN of Fmr1−/y mice appeared similar to that of controls (Fig.\\xa08f, g). Quantification of the overlapped pixels as a percent of the size of the ipsilateral patch confirmed this, as we found no difference between groups (Fmr1+/y: 10.21\\u2009±\\u20091.792, n\\u2009=\\u20094 mice; Fmr1−/y: 10.01\\u2009±\\u20090.6233, n\\u2009=\\u20096 mice; p\\u2009=\\u20090.9952, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa08h). Finally, we assessed geniculocortical projection organization by focally injecting CTb-555 into V1 to retrogradely label neurons in the dLGN (Fig.\\xa08i). Imaging of the origination zone (OZ) of labeled neurons revealed a similarly sized and shaped region in the dLGN of Fmr1+/y and Fmr1−/y mice (Fig.\\xa08j, k). Quantification of OZ size also revealed no significant difference between groups (Fmr1+/y: 16.31\\u2009±\\u20090.8233, n\\u2009=\\u20094 mice; Fmr1−/y: 16.47\\u2009±\\u20090.2582, n\\u2009=\\u20095 mice; p\\u2009=\\u20090.4286, K-S test) (Fig.\\xa08l). Taken together, these data suggest that the mature anatomical organization of projections along the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway are grossly normal in the absence of Fmr1. Combined with our retino- and corticocollicular tracing data, as well as our receptive field mapping, these data suggest that disruptions in V1 corticocollicular circuit formation may underlie deficits in visual function in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice.\\n\\nFig. 8 Topography of retinogeniculocortical pathway is preserved in Fmr1−/y mice. a Schematic of tracing paradigm to assess retinogeniculate topography. b, c Coronal sections through the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN, dashed area) reveal the termination zones (TZs) of focally labeled retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in Fmr1+/y (b) and Fmr1−/y (c) mice. d Quantification of the TZ size as a percent of the dLGN. e Schematic of tracing paradigm to assess eye-specific segregation in the dLGN. f, g Coronal sections through the dLGN (dashed area) reveal the terminations of bulk-labeled RGCs projecting from the contralateral (red) and ipsilateral (green) eye of Fmr1+/y (f) and Fmr1−/y (g) mice. h Quantification of the amount of overlap between ipsilateral and contralateral inputs in the dLGN, measured as a percent of the ipsilateral patch. i Schematic of tracing paradigm to assess geniculocortical topography. j, k Coronal sections through the dLGN (dashed area) reveal the origination zone (OZ) of geniculocortical neurons labeled in primary visual cortex of Fmr1+/y (l) and Fmr1−/y (g) mice. h Quantification of the OZ size as a percent of the dLGN.

While psychophysical data suggests visual deficits in patients with FXS, as well as premutation carriers, a circuit-level understanding of visual dysfunction is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that visual circuit function and organization in a critical midbrain nucleus are disrupted in a mouse model of FXS. Specifically, visual neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice exhibit enlarged receptive field areas and reduced direction selectivity. In addition, we found that AS neurons specifically are hyperexcitable in the absence of FMRP, though their tuning properties are unaffected. Interestingly, our axon tracing data reveal that inputs to the SC from V1, but not the retina, are disrupted, having larger TZs than those found in control animals. Overall, these data argue that deficits in visual processing and development of connectivity are subcircuit specific and thus suggest that FMRP may perform distinct functions in the assembly of different circuits. Further, elucidation of these deficits in the SC, a nucleus critically involved in the generation of goal-directed eye movements, opens the possibility for future investigations of the SC as a novel therapeutic target in FXS.\\n\\n\\nA novel role for FMRP in visual circuit formation in the SC\\n\\nThe development of properly organized receptive fields in the SC is likely due to a combination of molecular cues and activity-dependent forces that guide RGCs to the appropriate post-synaptic partners in the SC. Indeed, mutant mice lacking ephrin-A molecules involved in map formation exhibit misshapen receptive fields in the SC [21]. And, in mouse mutants in which the normal pattern of spontaneous retinal activity is disrupted (β2−/−), the receptive fields of neurons in the SC are increased and expanded along the azimuth axis [25]. Our findings in Fmr1−/y mice are similar to these data, suggesting a role for FMRP in the activity-dependent formation of retinocollicular connectivity. Interestingly; however, we did not observe a disruption in retinocollicular topography, which is evident in β2−/− mice [26], suggesting that the normal pattern of spontaneous retinal waves remain intact in Fmr1−/y mice and that FMRP is not required for wave-dependent RGC axon terminal refinement and pruning. We did find that V1 corticocollicular projections were disrupted and potentially misaligned with the retinal map. Based on our previous work suggesting visual map alignment is dependent on cholinergic retinal waves [23], these data suggest that FMRP may play a specific role in wave-driven refinement of V1-SC corticocollicular arbors, but not in wave-driven refinement of RGC terminals.\\n\\nPrevious studies suggest that both RGCs and V1 corticocollicular neurons establish connections with common post-synaptic targets in the SC [27], so it is unclear why retinocollicular refinement is unaffected in Fmr1−/y mice, but the refinement of V1-SC terminals is disrupted. Such specificity could be due to the regulation of FMRP expression temporally or spatially during development. Retinocollicular mapping occurs during the first postnatal week, while alignment of corticocollicular projections occurs in the second postnatal week [13]. Thus, FMRP expression in the SC could be temporally regulated: not expressed in the SC—and, thus, not required—during retinocollicular refinement, but expressed during V1-SC corticocollicular refinement to play a critical role in this process. Alternatively, FMRP expression could be restricted spatially, which could result in the differential effects of its loss on retinocollicular and corticocollicular refinement. That is, FMRP could be specifically expressed by V1 neurons projecting to the SC, but not in RGCs, during development. While there is evidence for FMRP expression in adult SC and retina [28, 29], a better understanding of the developmental timing of FMRP expression is needed in order to begin testing these possibilities.\\n\\n\\nAltered direction selectivity in Fmr1−/y mice\\n\\nThe nature of visual dysfunction in patients with FXS has been described as being specific to the magnocellular pathway [8], which in part processes information about object location and movement [30]. Intriguingly, we observed associated circuit-specific deficits in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice, in that direction selectivity is reduced and receptive field size is increased, which combined could reduce the ability to localize objects and detect their movement. Interestingly, however, while we found a decrease in DSI, this was not reflected in a significant change in the proportion of DS neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the remaining DS neurons are less selective, which could arise if DS neurons became more responsive to movement opposite to their preferred orientation. Another possibility is that this parameter of tuning is decreased in non-selective or AS neurons, perhaps due to the elevated basal and evoked firing rates we report here.\\n\\nOur data suggest a reduction in direction selectivity in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice, but the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. Recent studies in the mouse SC using distinct methodologies suggest that direction selectivity is inherited from DS RGCs [17, 18]. While our tracing data suggest that retinal projections to the SC are grossly normal, it remains possible that the specific connectivity patterns of DS RGCs are disrupted. Alternatively, the tuning and selectivity of DS RGCs could be affected, which is in turn relayed to SC neurons. Another possibility is that loss of FMRP expression results in a loss of DS neurons in the retina. Recent work suggests multiple changes in retinal function and synaptic protein expression; however, effects were primarily limited to the outer retina [31]. Future studies leveraging molecular markers of particular subtypes of RGCs and SC neurons are needed to determine if changes in tuning or loss of any specific cell type occurs in Fmr1−/y mice.\\n\\n\\nFMRP regulates the excitability, but not tuning, of axis-selective neurons\\n\\nIn many neurodevelopmental disorders, including FXS, alterations in excitatory-inhibitory balance have been reported in multiple circuits [32–35]. Intriguingly, we found that in the SC, alterations in excitability were restricted to AS neurons, while DS neurons and ON/OFF neurons in knockout SC showed similar spontaneous and evoked firing rates in comparison to controls. This subcircuit-specific change supports the hypothesis that FMRP performs distinct functions in a circuit-specific manner. But how might such a change occur? One possibility is an alteration in the number or strength of GABAergic inputs to AS neurons in the SC. In support of this, inhibitory neurons are densely packed into the SC [36] and the GABAergic transmission is dramatically altered in Fmr1−/y mice [37]. Alternatively, the disrupted organization and, presumably, connectivity of V1 corticocollicular neurons in the SC could underlie the increase in firing rate. Interestingly, the spontaneous rate of neurons in the SC was increased in a previous study in which the cortex was removed [14], supporting this possible mechanism. Optogenetic and/or chemogenetic manipulation of corticocollicular inputs or local inhibitory neurons are needed to further test these possibilities.\\n\\nSurprisingly, we found that despite the increased excitability of AS neurons in the SC of Fmr1−/y mice, the tuning properties—such as preferred directions, spatial frequency preference, and sharpness of tuning—of these neurons was spared. Thus, within the SC, FMRP may regulate the gain of AS neuron firing rate, which is separable from the selectivity. Interestingly, the tuning and gain of response are also separable for neurons in the SC that are tuned to a looming stimulus [38]. In that study, activation of V1 reduced the gain of looming neurons, but other aspects of tuning, such as preferred speed, were unaffected. These findings are consistent with our data, in that we found a disorganization of V1 corticocollicular projections. Thus, a primary function of V1-SC inputs may be to modulate the gain of multiple, but not all, SC subcircuits. It would be interesting to test this hypothesis directly using optogenetic techniques.\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nHere, we demonstrate different deficits in distinct visual subcircuits in the SC of a mouse model of FXS.

A selection of tube angulations were used under a controlled experiment and during a mock coronary angiography procedure. The Gafchromic XR&#x02010;QA2 film was able to confirm the asymmetric distribution of radiation dose to the breast and provide a normalized breast dose value. The right breast received the majority of dose for most of the tube angulations in the controlled experiment. However the left breast received the most radiation dose during the mock procedure. Asymmetric dose distribution to the breasts is normally not observed if Monte Carlo based simulations are performed because individual breast dose calculations are not available.

INTRODUCTION</title><p>Coronary angiography (CA) is an interventional diagnostic procedure used to assess cardiovascular disease. During a CA procedure the primary X&#x02010;ray beam may be intercepted by the breasts depending on the tube angulation chosen. However most of the primary X&#x02010;ray beam is attenuated by tissue in the torso before reaching the breasts, thus only a small fraction of the radiation is expected to be deposited in the breasts. For certain angulations and in the breast slices further away from the chest, it is likely that scattered radiation will be the main contributor of dose to the breasts because the X&#x02010;ray beam may not intercept the breasts and because of the increased attenuation through the torso due to distance. The absorbed dose to the breast should be evenly distributed if an equal number of views are taken from the left and right side at similar angles. However, due to the slightly off&#x02010;centered position of the heart, the dose deposited in the breasts could be asymmetric.</p><p>Breast dose measurements can be found in the literature,<xref rid=\"acm20532-bib-0001\" ref-type=\"ref\">\\n<sup>1</sup>\\n</xref>, <xref rid=\"acm20532-bib-0002\" ref-type=\"ref\">\\n<sup>2</sup>\\n</xref>, <xref rid=\"acm20532-bib-0003\" ref-type=\"ref\">\\n<sup>3</sup>\\n</xref>, <xref rid=\"acm20532-bib-0004\" ref-type=\"ref\">\\n<sup>4</sup>\\n</xref> however these are normally performed using thermoluminescence dosimeter (TLD) or Monte Carlo&#x02010;based simulations with neither method expressing individual breast dose nor the breast dose distribution. Radiochromic film has the advantage of providing spatial dose information over point&#x02010;dose measurements and was used to assess breast dose distribution in coronary angiography. The effective dose from a routine CA can range from 3.4&#x02010;5.6 mSv, from previous literature.<xref rid=\"acm20532-bib-0001\" ref-type=\"ref\">\\n<sup>1</sup>\\n</xref>, <xref rid=\"acm20532-bib-0004\" ref-type=\"ref\">\\n<sup>4</sup>\\n</xref>\\n</p><p>The dose&#x02010;area product (DAP) is commonly used to monitor the output of an X&#x02010;ray tube as an indirect indicator of patient dose. It is defined as the integral dose over the area intersected by the X&#x02010;ray beam. In this instance it is used as a normalization factor for breast dose.</p></sec><sec id=\"acm20532-sec-0002\"><title>II.

In the case of mock CA procedure, the accumulative breast dose measured for the duration of the procedure was then divided by the total DAP reading.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>The Gafchromic film clearly demonstrates the asymmetric dose distribution in the sagittal and transverse planes of the breasts. <xref rid=\"acm20532-fig-0004\" ref-type=\"fig\">Figure 4</xref> shows the absorbed dose at the breast entrance (anterior chest) for the left and right breasts as the tube angulation changed from PA to RAO 10&#x000b0; to LAO 10&#x000b0;. This is due to the X&#x02010;ray beam exposing a larger portion of one breast as the X&#x02010;ray beam changes direction.</p><p>\\n<xref rid=\"acm20532-fig-0005\" ref-type=\"fig\">Figure 5</xref> shows the dose distribution at each of the three planes for the left and right breasts for a PA and RAO 10&#x000b0; tube angulation. At each sequential plane, the amount of radiation deposited in the breast is reduced due to the primary X&#x02010;ray beam being attenuated through the breast, and the X&#x02010;ray field intersecting the breast has also diminished. In the case where the tube is angled, a reduced area of the beam is intersecting one of the breasts, as demonstrated in <xref rid=\"acm20532-fig-0006\" ref-type=\"fig\">Fig. 6</xref>.</p><p>In the experiment, the right breast measured a greater deposition of radiation dose than the left breast for almost all tube angulations investigated in this study. The mean DAP value for the single and combined tube angulations were 79.7 and <mml:math id=\"nlm-math-35\"><mml:mn>83.8</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Gy</mml:mtext><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext>cm</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math>, respectively. <xref rid=\"acm20532-fig-0007\" ref-type=\"fig\">Figure 7</xref> shows the breast dose conversion factors in the LAO&#x02010;RAO direction, clearly demonstrating an asymmetric dose distribution to the breasts in the PA position where the dose to the right breast is 47% greater than the left breast. This trend continues as the tube moves towards the RAO direction but not in the LAO direction. A possible explanation for this is the left breast is slightly smaller in dimension compared to the right breast, thus a fraction of the X&#x02010;ray beam is deposited outside the breast boundary and does not contribute to the left breast dose. Considering the right breast is almost completely out of the primary X&#x02010;ray beam in the LAO direction for large angles, it is assumed that the dose measured in the right breast under these circumstances arises from internal scattering by the tissues inside the phantom. This would also be true in the RAO angulations in regards to the scattered radiation deposited in the left breast.</p><fig fig-type=\"Figure\" xml:lang=\"en\" id=\"acm20532-fig-0004\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Gafchromic film placed on RANDO\\'s chest (breast slice 1) demonstrating asymmetric breast dose as tube angulations changed from the PA position.</p></caption><graphic id=\"nlm-graphic-7\" xlink:href=\"ACM2-17-532-g004\"/></fig><fig fig-type=\"Figure\" xml:lang=\"en\" id=\"acm20532-fig-0005\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Gafchromic film placed at each of the three planes for left and right breasts for PA and RAO 10&#x000b0; tube angulations.

This could be a statistical error, as both measurements overlap their respective uncertainty range. The overall breast dose appears to behave more quadratic in the LAO direction than in the RAO direction.</p><p>\\n<xref rid=\"acm20532-fig-0008\" ref-type=\"fig\">Figure 8</xref> is the breast dose conversion factors in the CAU&#x02010;CRA direction and it illustrates a difference in dose between the left and right breasts that remains quite consistent, between 40% and 56% greater in the right breast than the left, with the exception of CRA 40&#x000b0;, where the difference is only 16%. Since the X&#x02010;ray tube is not biased to either side of the patient where one breast can be exposed to more primary beam radiation than the other in the LAO&#x02010;RAO configurations, this confirms the asymmetric distribution of radiation to the breasts. The overall breast dose in the CRA direction drops off much quicker than the CAU direction, which drops off in a quadratic manner. This is because in the CRA position, the X&#x02010;ray beam is greatly attenuated by tissue in the abdomen before reaching the breasts, whereas in the CAU position, the X&#x02010;ray beam is mainly traversing the lungs, which have less attenuating property compared to the abdomen region.</p><p>\\n<xref rid=\"acm20532-fig-0009\" ref-type=\"fig\">Figure 9</xref> reveals that the relationship with breast dose for combined tube angulations is not as simple to discern. As the cranial angle increases, the overall breast dose decreases, irrespective of the LAO&#x02010;RAO component, suggesting a strong influence in attenuation behavior in the cranial angle when combined tube angulations are involved. For combined tube angulations with a CAU component, the same influence is not apparent. Instead a decreasing angle in LAO component seems to dominate the breast dose behavior, suggesting a stronger influence by the LAO&#x02010;RAO angulations when caudal angles are involved in a combined effect. However due to the limited projections investigated in combination with CAU, the findings here are not definitive.</p><fig fig-type=\"Figure\" xml:lang=\"en\" id=\"acm20532-fig-0007\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Histogram of the left, right, and overall breast dose conversions in LAO&#x02010;RAO direction.

These factors will affect the patient dose and, in turn, the breast dose received by the patient. Since the breast dose will be proportional to the DAP value and it is common to use normalized DAP for dose conversion factors, thus the proposed breast dose conversion factors in this paper are normalized to DAP. Realistically, the breasts are not rigid and do not sit upright like the RANDO phantom when lying supine, but rather fall to the side of the patient. Therefore the breast dose conversion factors could be higher than the expected values quoted in this study.</p><p>DAP&#x02010;to&#x02010;effective dose conversion factors can often be found in the literature.

During a clinical procedure, the floating table top is enabled to allow easy manipulation of patient movement. Therefore the cardiologist may position the patient in such a manner that the X&#x02010;ray beam spends more time on the left or right side of the patient. However in the controlled experiment, the floating patient table top was locked in a fixed position to allow reproducibility of phantom positioning. This explains why the right breast measured a higher dose in the controlled experiment, but a higher dose in the left breast was measured in the mock CA procedure. This suggests the contribution to the asymmetric distribution of the breast dose is not solely dependent on the tube angulation used, but also dependent on the table translation movements which can result in one breast always receiving a greater radiation dose than the other at the discretion of the operator.</p><p>An advantage of using Gafchromic film is the ability to capture two&#x02010;dimensional dose distribution, whereas TLDs can only provide a single dose point measurement unless a large quantity of TLDs are placed inside the organ of interest. Also, the primary beam and scattered beam radiation deposited in the breast is more readily depicted by Gafchromic film and can be quantified. Monte Carlo methods are a convenient tool for calculating absorbed organ dose and effective dose without the need to make physical measurements if the necessary parameters are made available (e.g., patient size, tube geometry, distances, X&#x02010;ray field size, X&#x02010;ray output, etc.). But unlike Gafchromic film, most Monte&#x02010;Carlo&#x02010;based simulations only provide a single absorbed breast dose value; thus asymmetry of dose distribution will not be revealed. Thus Gafchromic film can be used both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p><p>Limitations of the Gafchromic film are that it is nonreusable, unlike TLDs or Monte Carlo simulations, and the minimal dose required for the film to be readable within an uncertainty of 15% was found to be at least 10 mGy in this experiment.</p></sec><sec id=\"acm20532-sec-0004\"><title>IV.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nCoronary angiography (CA) is an interventional diagnostic procedure used to assess cardiovascular disease. During a CA procedure the primary X‐ray beam may be intercepted by the breasts depending on the tube angulation chosen. However most of the primary X‐ray beam is attenuated by tissue in the torso before reaching the breasts, thus only a small fraction of the radiation is expected to be deposited in the breasts. For certain angulations and in the breast slices further away from the chest, it is likely that scattered radiation will be the main contributor of dose to the breasts because the X‐ray beam may not intercept the breasts and because of the increased attenuation through the torso due to distance. The absorbed dose to the breast should be evenly distributed if an equal number of views are taken from the left and right side at similar angles. However, due to the slightly off‐centered position of the heart, the dose deposited in the breasts could be asymmetric.\\n\\nBreast dose measurements can be found in the literature,1, 2, 3, 4 however these are normally performed using thermoluminescence dosimeter (TLD) or Monte Carlo‐based simulations with neither method expressing individual breast dose nor the breast dose distribution. Radiochromic film has the advantage of providing spatial dose information over point‐dose measurements and was used to assess breast dose distribution in coronary angiography. The effective dose from a routine CA can range from 3.4‐5.6 mSv, from previous literature.1, 4\\n\\nThe dose‐area product (DAP) is commonly used to monitor the output of an X‐ray tube as an indirect indicator of patient dose. It is defined as the integral dose over the area intersected by the X‐ray beam. In this instance it is used as a normalization factor for breast dose.\\n\\n\\nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\nGafchromic XR‐QA2 film (Ashland Inc., Covington, KY) was placed inside the breast slices of a RANDO phantom(5) (Radiology Support Devices, Inc., Long Beach, CA) to evaluate dose distribution as shown in Fig. 1, and a series of CT axial slices of the RANDO phantom with breast attachments is shown in Fig. 2.\\n\\nThe film was calibrated between 0 mGy and 160 mGy on a dedicated cardiac angiography unit (Shimadzu BRANSIST Safire HF9, Shimadzu Medical Systems, Torrance, CA, with flat panel detector and filtration of 1 mm Aluminum (Rad ‐ DA protocol/BH 2 filter)) in manual mode and automatic brightness control (ABC) mode. ABC mode was selected because it is the common acquisition mode for clinical angiography units.\\n\\nFigure 1 Gafchromic XR‐QA2 film placed on RANDO's chest and the subsequent breast slices. The regions not covered by Gafchromic film is the location of the pegs that hold the breast slices in place when stacked together.\\n\\nFigure 2 A series of CT axial slices of RANDO phantom with breast attachments in 2.5 cm increments. The breast slices sit on the chest anterior, appear slightly asymmetric, and are very rigid.\\n\\nThe film was placed side by side with a solid‐state detector (Piranha dose probe R100B, RTI Electronics AB, Mölndal, Sweden) on the patient table during the calibration. In ABC mode, beam attenuators such as PMMA, aluminum, and copper sheets were used to manipulate the system to stabilize the generator to produce the kVp most commonly seen in clinical settings.(6) Solid‐state (SD) detectors tend to underestimate the dose in phantom measurement because they are less sensitive to scatter radiation from backscatter and the peripheral compared to an ionization chamber (IC).(7) Correction factors to compensate for solid‐state detector response to match ionization chamber responses for the manual mode and ABC mode are 1.4 and 2, respectively. These correction factors were measured separately in a different experiment by the author(6) and have been incorporated into the calibration curves. The outcome was the two calibration methods behaved in a similar manner at the dose range of interest.\\n\\nThe calibrated film was scanned and digitized on an Epson V700 (Epson America Inc., Long Beach, CA) dual‐lens flatbed scanner using a reflective scanning mode in 48‐bit color, 300 dpi resolution, and no correction or color control selected.6, 8 The mean pixel values (MPV) extracted from the Gafchromic XR‐QA2 films were converted to absorbed dose using the calibration curves in Fig. 3.\\n\\nA circular mask was used to ensure that only exposure within the breast slice was extracted from the film to be included in calculating the absorbed breast dose. Breast organ dose was calculated as the weighted mean dose value deposited on the XR‐QA2 film located within the breast slices. Individual breast organ doses for each left and right breast were also calculated using a mass‐weighted average method as expressed in the equations below, where l1 stands for the mean dose measured at breast slice 1 and so on:(1)Dleft=l1×(0.20.45)+l2×(0.180.45)+l3×(0.070.45)(2)Dright=l1×(0.250.55)+l2×(0.180.55)+l3×(0.170.55)The breast dose was then calculated as a weighted average of the weight of each breast, Dbreast=(Dleft×0.45)+(Dright×0.55). Table 1 illustrates the dimensions and weights of each breast slice.\\n\\nFigure 3 Calibration curves used to convert MPV from digitized film to dose values. The “manual cal fitted curve” was used for the controlled experiment and the “ABC cal fitted curve” was used for the mock CA procedure.\\n\\nIn this experiment, tube angulations are defined into two arrangements, single and combined. A single tube angulation refers to the angle being changed in either the transverse or sagittal plane, and a combined tube angulation is where the angle changes in both transverse and sagittal planes.\\n\\nA series of single and combined tube angulations based on typical tube angulations for a CA procedure9, 10 were used in the experiment and these are listed in Table 2. The fluoroscopic unit used in the experiment is the same as the unit used for the film calibrations. Manual exposures at 84 kVp, 400 mA, and 20 ms in acquisition mode at a source‐to‐image receptor distance of 100 cm and a 15 cm field of view (FOV) were used. A total of six 10‐second exposures were made per tube angulation. This was to expose the film with enough radiation to obtain a measureable dose with small uncertainty. The patient table remained in a stationary position throughout the experiment.\\n\\nTo assess a clinical case, a mock CA procedure was performed by an experienced cardiology registrar in ABC mode. The mock CA procedure consisted a sequence of nine acquisitions which included the seven combined tube angulations and one single angulation from the experiment, plus an additional RAO\\xa033°/CAU\\xa04° configuration with a 23 cm field of view to assess the left ventricle functionality (LV view) as routinely performed at the end of a CA procedure. Table 3 lists out the tube angulations and the parameters recorded during the mock CA procedure.\\n\\nTable 1\\nLeft Breast\\tRight Breast\\nSlice 1\\tSlice 2\\tSlice 3\\tSlice 1\\tSlice 2\\tSlice 3\\nLength (cm)\\t12.3\\t11\\t9\\t12.5\\t11\\t9.2\\nWidth (cm)\\t11.7\\t10.5\\t8.8\\t11.9\\t10.5\\t9\\nHeight (cm)\\t2.5\\nWeight (kg)\\t0.2\\t0.18\\t0.07\\t0.25\\t0.18\\t0.12\\nTotal weight (measured)\\t0.45 kg (\\t0.55 kg (\\n\\nTable 2\\nLAO 10°\\tRAO 10°\\tCRA 10°\\tCAU 10°\\nLAO 30°\\tRAO 30°\\tCRA 30°\\tCAU 30°\\nLAO 40°\\tRAO 40°\\tCRA 40°\\tCAU 40°\\nPA (straight)\\tLAO\\tLAO\\tLAO\\nRAO\\tRAO\\tRAO\\tRAO\\n\\nTable 3\\nTube Angulations\\tSID (cm)\\tTube Factors kV/mA/ms\\tNo. of Frames\\tTime\\tDAP\\n#1\\tLAO\\t101\\t79\\t35\\t4.7\\t1.22\\n#2\\tCAU39°\\t96\\t79\\t27\\t3.6\\t0.94\\n#3\\tRAO\\t102\\t99\\t34\\t4.5\\t1.19\\n#4\\tLAO\\t104\\t101\\t42\\t5.6\\t1.46\\n#5\\tLAO\\t98\\t87\\t32\\t4.3\\t1.12\\n#6\\tLAO\\t96\\t83\\t31\\t4.1\\t1.08\\n#7\\tRAO\\t99\\t80\\t39\\t5.2\\t1.36\\n#8\\tRAO\\t99\\t77\\t32\\t4.3\\t1.12\\n#9\\tRAO\\t99\\t71\\t131\\t8.7\\t4.57\\nTotal DAP\\t14.06\\n\\nThe breast dose measured for each tube angulation was then divided by the DAP reading recorded for the 60 s of exposure to calculate the normalized breast dose conversion factor for the controlled experiment. In the case of mock CA procedure, the accumulative breast dose measured for the duration of the procedure was then divided by the total DAP reading. This allows for scenarios where individual tube angulation details are not available, but a breast dose can still be estimated based on a generic routine CA procedure that uses similar tube angulations as the mock CA procedure presented here in this study.\\n\\n\\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\n\\nThe Gafchromic film clearly demonstrates the asymmetric dose distribution in the sagittal and transverse planes of the breasts. Figure 4 shows the absorbed dose at the breast entrance (anterior chest) for the left and right breasts as the tube angulation changed from PA to RAO 10° to LAO 10°. This is due to the X‐ray beam exposing a larger portion of one breast as the X‐ray beam changes direction.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5 shows the dose distribution at each of the three planes for the left and right breasts for a PA and RAO 10° tube angulation. At each sequential plane, the amount of radiation deposited in the breast is reduced due to the primary X‐ray beam being attenuated through the breast, and the X‐ray field intersecting the breast has also diminished. In the case where the tube is angled, a reduced area of the beam is intersecting one of the breasts, as demonstrated in Fig. 6.\\n\\nIn the experiment, the right breast measured a greater deposition of radiation dose than the left breast for almost all tube angulations investigated in this study. The mean DAP value for the single and combined tube angulations were 79.7 and 83.8\\xa0Gy.cm2, respectively. Figure 7 shows the breast dose conversion factors in the LAO‐RAO direction, clearly demonstrating an asymmetric dose distribution to the breasts in the PA position where the dose to the right breast is 47% greater than the left breast. This trend continues as the tube moves towards the RAO direction but not in the LAO direction. A possible explanation for this is the left breast is slightly smaller in dimension compared to the right breast, thus a fraction of the X‐ray beam is deposited outside the breast boundary and does not contribute to the left breast dose. Considering the right breast is almost completely out of the primary X‐ray beam in the LAO direction for large angles, it is assumed that the dose measured in the right breast under these circumstances arises from internal scattering by the tissues inside the phantom. This would also be true in the RAO angulations in regards to the scattered radiation deposited in the left breast.\\n\\nFigure 4 Gafchromic film placed on RANDO's chest (breast slice 1) demonstrating asymmetric breast dose as tube angulations changed from the PA position.\\n\\nFigure 5 Gafchromic film placed at each of the three planes for left and right breasts for PA and RAO 10° tube angulations. The first row corresponds to breast slice 1, second row corresponds to breast slice 2, and the last row corresponds to breast slice 3. The circular mask shows the outline of the breast slice.\\n\\nFigure 6 X‐ray beam path outlined for LAO‐RAO tube angulations.\\n\\nOne anomaly is LAO 40°, where the left breast measured a slightly higher dose than the right. This could be a statistical error, as both measurements overlap their respective uncertainty range. The overall breast dose appears to behave more quadratic in the LAO direction than in the RAO direction.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8 is the breast dose conversion factors in the CAU‐CRA direction and it illustrates a difference in dose between the left and right breasts that remains quite consistent, between 40% and 56% greater in the right breast than the left, with the exception of CRA 40°, where the difference is only 16%. Since the X‐ray tube is not biased to either side of the patient where one breast can be exposed to more primary beam radiation than the other in the LAO‐RAO configurations, this confirms the asymmetric distribution of radiation to the breasts. The overall breast dose in the CRA direction drops off much quicker than the CAU direction, which drops off in a quadratic manner. This is because in the CRA position, the X‐ray beam is greatly attenuated by tissue in the abdomen before reaching the breasts, whereas in the CAU position, the X‐ray beam is mainly traversing the lungs, which have less attenuating property compared to the abdomen region.\\n\\n\\nFigure 9 reveals that the relationship with breast dose for combined tube angulations is not as simple to discern. As the cranial angle increases, the overall breast dose decreases, irrespective of the LAO‐RAO component, suggesting a strong influence in attenuation behavior in the cranial angle when combined tube angulations are involved. For combined tube angulations with a CAU component, the same influence is not apparent. Instead a decreasing angle in LAO component seems to dominate the breast dose behavior, suggesting a stronger influence by the LAO‐RAO angulations when caudal angles are involved in a combined effect. However due to the limited projections investigated in combination with CAU, the findings here are not definitive.\\n\\nFigure 7 Histogram of the left, right, and overall breast dose conversions in LAO‐RAO direction. Error bars are ±8.5%.\\n\\nFigure 8 Histogram of the left, right, and overall breast dose conversions in the CAU‐CRA direction. Error bars are ±8.5%.\\n\\nContrary to the experiment, the left breast had a higher dose than the right breast in the mock CA procedure, as shown in Fig. 10, and also demonstrates hot spots within the breast planes. The total DAP for the mock CA procedure was 14.06\\xa0Gy.cm2 and the measured left, right and overall breast doses were 2.3, 1.17, and 1.7 mGy, respectively. These measurements resulted in a normalized dose conversion factor of 0.16\\xa0mGy/Gy.cm2 for the left breast, 0.08\\xa0mGy/Gy.cm2 for the right breast, and a normalized overall breast dose of 0.12\\xa0mGy/Gy.cm2. Breast dose measurements from the literature1, 2, 3, 4 ranged from 0.03 to 0.12\\xa0mGy/Gy.cm2. The findings from this study are in line with the values found in the literature, although the approach of using Gafchromic film to measure breast dose in coronary angiography hasn't been used before.\\n\\nApplying the breast dose conversion factors from the controlled experiment to the DAP values recorded for the mock CA procedure (column 7, Table 3), the breast dose was calculated as 1.7±0.15\\xa0mGy. For acquisition #9, the breast dose conversion factor for the 15 cm FOV was used, since there were no data for the larger FOV. While the actual measurement made from the Gafchromic film in the mock CA procedure resulted in the same breast dose (1.7±0.11\\xa0mGy).\\n\\nFigure 9 Histogram of left, right, and overall breast dose conversions for the combined tube angulations. Error bars are ±8.5%.\\n\\nFigure 10 Dose distribution of the left and right breasts in three planes from the mock CA procedure. The left breast received 2.3±6.5%\\xa0mGy, the right breast received 1.17\\xa0mGy±6.5%, and the overall breast dose was 1.7±6.5%.\\n\\nThe DAP value is a measure of the X‐ray tube output and is dependent on various factors such as geometry, X‐ray field area, X‐ray generator parameters, patient thickness, table attenuation, ABC feedback, exposure time, and complexity of the interventional case. These factors will affect the patient dose and, in turn, the breast dose received by the patient. Since the breast dose will be proportional to the DAP value and it is common to use normalized DAP for dose conversion factors, thus the proposed breast dose conversion factors in this paper are normalized to DAP. Realistically, the breasts are not rigid and do not sit upright like the RANDO phantom when lying supine, but rather fall to the side of the patient. Therefore the breast dose conversion factors could be higher than the expected values quoted in this study.\\n\\nDAP‐to‐effective dose conversion factors can often be found in the literature. As an example, a typical DAP value for a CA is 82\\xa0Gy.cm2 at the hospital where this study was performed. If a DAP‐to‐effective dose conversion factor of 0.2\\xa0mSv/Gy.cm2(4) and the breast dose conversion factor of 0.12\\xa0mGy/Gy.cm2 are applied, the resultant effective dose would be 16.4 mSv and the breast dose 9.8 mGy.\\n\\nThe main difference between the controlled experiment and the mock CA procedure is the use of the floating patient table top. During a clinical procedure, the floating table top is enabled to allow easy manipulation of patient movement. Therefore the cardiologist may position the patient in such a manner that the X‐ray beam spends more time on the left or right side of the patient. However in the controlled experiment, the floating patient table top was locked in a fixed position to allow reproducibility of phantom positioning. This explains why the right breast measured a higher dose in the controlled experiment, but a higher dose in the left breast was measured in the mock CA procedure. This suggests the contribution to the asymmetric distribution of the breast dose is not solely dependent on the tube angulation used, but also dependent on the table translation movements which can result in one breast always receiving a greater radiation dose than the other at the discretion of the operator.\\n\\nAn advantage of using Gafchromic film is the ability to capture two‐dimensional dose distribution, whereas TLDs can only provide a single dose point measurement unless a large quantity of TLDs are placed inside the organ of interest. Also, the primary beam and scattered beam radiation deposited in the breast is more readily depicted by Gafchromic film and can be quantified. Monte Carlo methods are a convenient tool for calculating absorbed organ dose and effective dose without the need to make physical measurements if the necessary parameters are made available (e.g., patient size, tube geometry, distances, X‐ray field size, X‐ray output, etc.). But unlike Gafchromic film, most Monte‐Carlo‐based simulations only provide a single absorbed breast dose value; thus asymmetry of dose distribution will not be revealed. Thus Gafchromic film can be used both qualitatively and quantitatively.\\n\\nLimitations of the Gafchromic film are that it is nonreusable, unlike TLDs or Monte Carlo simulations, and the minimal dose required for the film to be readable within an uncertainty of 15% was found to be at least 10 mGy in this experiment.\\n\\n\\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nAsymmetric breast dose distribution was successfully demonstrated using Gafchromic XR‐QA2 film during a mock coronary angiogram procedure and for a collection of single and combined tube angulations frequently used in CA. The controlled experiment provided a method for estimating the left and right breast dose, as well as the overall breast dose, if the DAP and tube angulation are known per acquisition.\\n\\nIf DAP and tube angulation are unknown, the application of a typical CA would give a normalized dose conversion factor of 0.16\\xa0mGy/Gy.cm2 for the left breast and 0.08\\xa0mGy/Gy.cm2 for the right breast. Thus the overall breast dose conversion factor is 0.12\\xa0mGy/Gy.cm2.\\n\\nAsymmetric breast dose distribution is dependent on tube angulation and is related to the use of the floating patient table top by the operator.\\n\\n\\nCOPYRIGHT\\n\\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Asymmetric breast dose in coronary angiography', 'journal_title': 'Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics'}\n",

Both genomic and cell&#x02010;based experiments indicate that cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;extracellular matrix adhesion processes seem to be disrupted in non&#x02010;malignant cells of women at high risk for <styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FBC</styled-content> and suggest a potential role for these processes in <styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FBC</styled-content> development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type=\"author-generated\"><kwd id=\"msb156506-kwd-0001\">breast cancer</kwd><kwd id=\"msb156506-kwd-0002\">cellular adhesion</kwd><kwd id=\"msb156506-kwd-0003\">disease susceptibility</kwd><kwd id=\"msb156506-kwd-0004\">multiomic analysis, signaling pathways</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type=\"subject-categories\"><title>Subject Categories</title><kwd>Genome-Scale &#x00026; Integrative Biology</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH</funding-source><award-id>R01GM085601</award-id><award-id>5T32CA093247</award-id><award-id>1R01HG005692</award-id><award-id>UO1 CA084955</award-id><award-id>U01CA69446</award-id><award-id>UL1RR025764</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Center for Research Resources</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Cancer Institute</funding-source><award-id>P30CA042014</award-id><award-id>UM1 CA164920</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count=\"16\"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>msb156506</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>March 2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:4.8.5 mode:remove_FC converted:30.03.2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type=\"self-citation\">\\n<mixed-citation publication-type=\"journal\" id=\"msb156506-cit-1001\">\\n<source>Mol Syst Biol.</source> (<year>2016</year>) <volume>12</volume>: 860</mixed-citation>\\n</p></notes></front><body><sec id=\"msb156506-sec-0001\"><title>Introduction</title><p>The biological basis for breast cancer has been clarified by studies that have described risk factors that influence tumor development. Such risk factors include genetic risk alleles and expression levels for individual genes (Miki <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0042\" ref-type=\"ref\">1994</xref>; Wooster <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0081\" ref-type=\"ref\">1994</xref>). However, breast tumorigenesis arises from a complex interplay among genes within signaling pathways. When one or more components of a given network are disrupted, cells may have a greater propensity to transform, proliferate, and invade surrounding tissue (Hanahan &#x00026; Weinberg, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0021\" ref-type=\"ref\">2011</xref>). Importantly, dysregulation of different genes within the same pathway may have a similar impact on downstream pathway function (Yarden &#x00026; Sliwkowski, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0083\" ref-type=\"ref\">2001</xref>; Wood <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0080\" ref-type=\"ref\">2007</xref>). Accordingly, to gain a broader perspective of the molecular aberrations that contribute to tumor development, it is valuable to evaluate data at the pathway level rather than evaluating single genes. Furthermore, by evaluating pathway activity using multiple types of &#x0201c;omic&#x0201d; data&#x02014;including both DNA variation and gene expression changes&#x02014;it is possible to develop a more complete picture of disease mechanisms. In addition, by examining pathway dysregulation in normal cells, one can better understand the processes by which germline variation leads to tumorigenesis; such effects should be observable not only in normal mammary epithelial cells but also in peripheral blood cells, which can be obtained less invasively (Liew <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0035\" ref-type=\"ref\">2006</xref>; Mohr &#x00026; Liew, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0044\" ref-type=\"ref\">2007</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that by comparing molecular profiles for women from high&#x02010;risk families who have developed breast cancer against women from high&#x02010;risk families who have not developed breast cancer, we might identify biological pathways that play a role in development of familial breast cancer (FBC). In addition, we hypothesized that transcriptomic profiling&#x02014;summarized at the pathway level&#x02014;would enable us to account for common downstream effects of different germline variants across many women who develop FBC. In other words, even though individuals who develop FBC may differ in the specific germline variants that they carry, those variants may affect similar signaling networks and have similar downstream transcriptional consequences.</p><p>Transcriptional profiling has been used widely to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer phenotypes (Miller <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0043\" ref-type=\"ref\">2005</xref>; Bild <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0008\" ref-type=\"ref\">2006</xref>; Huang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0023\" ref-type=\"ref\">2007</xref>; Langenau <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0029\" ref-type=\"ref\">2007</xref>; Rhodes <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0054\" ref-type=\"ref\">2007</xref>; Liu <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0037\" ref-type=\"ref\">2008</xref>; Waddell <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0073\" ref-type=\"ref\">2008</xref>; Wong <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0079\" ref-type=\"ref\">2008</xref>; Barbie <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0005\" ref-type=\"ref\">2009</xref>; Ooi <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0047\" ref-type=\"ref\">2009</xref>; Singh <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0062\" ref-type=\"ref\">2009</xref>; Zhang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0084\" ref-type=\"ref\">2009</xref>). In normal cells, gene expression levels reflect functional germline genetic (and epigenomic) variation and thus may be useful as a surrogate for germline variation. Associations between genetic and transcriptomic variation were initially mapped in yeast where it was shown that genetic variants in parental yeast influence expression traits in progeny (Steinmetz <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0064\" ref-type=\"ref\">2002</xref>). Subsequent studies have identified thousands of expression quantitative trait loci in the human genome (Morley <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0045\" ref-type=\"ref\">2004</xref>; Schadt <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0056\" ref-type=\"ref\">2008</xref>), and additional research has demonstrated that global mRNA expression patterns can reflect heritable disease susceptibility (Mohr &#x00026; Liew, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0044\" ref-type=\"ref\">2007</xref>; Cookson <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0013\" ref-type=\"ref\">2009</xref>). For example, in individuals who carry BRCA1/2 mutations, expression patterns in lymphoblastoid cells are distinct from those in individuals who do not carry these mutations (Waddell <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0073\" ref-type=\"ref\">2008</xref>). Such downstream effects have also been observed in tumors (Hedenfalk <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0022\" ref-type=\"ref\">2001</xref>), suggesting that gene expression levels can reflect germline variation.</p><p>We performed a gene expression analysis to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in two patient cohorts that included women who had a family history of breast cancer; approximately half of these women had developed breast cancer, while the others had not. We also examined germline DNA variation in a subset of these samples to test for consistency of pathway dysregulation across these genomic data types. To study the biological mechanisms of FBC, we mapped the data to 932 canonical signaling pathways (Subramanian <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0068\" ref-type=\"ref\">2005</xref>; Kanehisa <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0025\" ref-type=\"ref\">2006</xref>; Taube <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0070\" ref-type=\"ref\">2010</xref>; Byers <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0009\" ref-type=\"ref\">2013</xref>) and used these data to discover pathway&#x02010;specific patterns that differed between individuals who developed FBC and those who did not. Multiple pathways related to cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion showed significant differences in gene expression and germline variation. Next, to verify whether these observations generalize to breast tissue, we performed a pathway analysis on two gene expression data sets that profiled normal breast tissue from women who had a family history of breast cancer and/or carried a mutation in BRCA1/2 and compared them against control women from the same studies. Again, various cell adhesion pathways attained statistical significance in these data sets. Based on these findings, we used cell&#x02010;based functional assays and fluorescence microscopy to compare cell adhesion properties of normal mammary epithelial cells between women who had undergone prophylactic mastectomy due to a breast cancer family history and women who had undergone a breast reduction surgery for reasons unrelated to breast cancer risk (these served as controls).</p><p>In support of our genomic findings, we observed significant differences in cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;ECM phenotypes for the prophylactic mastectomy cells compared with the controls. Specifically, normal cells from FBC women showed: (i) decreased cell adhesion abilities, (ii) increased cell death when treated with drugs that modulate cell adhesion capacity, and (iii) aberrant morphological features. Taken together, these findings, derived from multiple computational and experimental analyses on multiple tissue types, implicate dysregulated cell adhesion pathways in FBC development.</p></sec><sec id=\"msb156506-sec-0002\"><title>Results</title><sec id=\"msb156506-sec-0003\"><title>Overview of approach to identify familial breast cancer susceptibility pathways by multi&#x02010;omic profiling</title><p>Our initial analyses aimed to identify pathways that differed between women who developed FBC and those who did not, across multiple types of omic data. Because germline variation drives transcriptional changes that should be observable in both peripheral blood cells and breast cells, we obtained gene expression data for PBMCs and normal breast cells across four independent cohorts (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"msb156506-fig-0001\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>B and C).

Ongoing efforts to genotype ever&#x02010;larger cohorts have also yielded common susceptibility variants (Michailidou <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0041\" ref-type=\"ref\">2013</xref>); however, in total, known susceptibility variants explain &#x0003c;&#x000a0;30% of familial risk (Stratton &#x00026; Rahman, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0066\" ref-type=\"ref\">2008</xref>). Accordingly, new complimentary approaches are needed to identify genomic factors that drive FBC risk. In our study, we took a multi&#x02010;omic approach and searched for multigene patterns associated with FBC development, irrespective of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation status. Our approach is based on the premise that germline genetic and epigenomic variations cause gene expression changes in normal cells that reflect a person\\'s risk for eventual tumor development. Upon examining gene expression levels and protein&#x02010;coding variants for women who did or did not develop FBC, we identified signaling pathways with consistent differences between the groups, including pathways related to cell adhesion, integrin signaling, and growth signaling. We also evaluated normal breast cells using fluorescence microscopy, functional assays, and pharmacologic assays; each provided additional evidence that cell adhesion pathways are dysregulated in high&#x02010;risk women. These findings complement prior research, which has shown that blood&#x02010;derived molecular signatures reflect dysregulated molecular processes in breast tissue (Sharma <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0060\" ref-type=\"ref\">2005</xref>; Aar&#x000f8;e <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0001\" ref-type=\"ref\">2010</xref>; Tudoran <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0071\" ref-type=\"ref\">2014</xref>), that dysregulation of cell adhesion genes can be identified in blood cells from breast cancer patients (Tudoran <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0071\" ref-type=\"ref\">2014</xref>), and that germline variants in cell adhesion pathway genes contribute to breast cancer risk (Ayala <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0004\" ref-type=\"ref\">2003</xref>; Langsenlehner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0031\" ref-type=\"ref\">2006</xref>; Liu <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0039\" ref-type=\"ref\">2013</xref>). Our analysis extends these observations by aggregating pathway&#x02010;level genomic data from four independent patient populations (five data sets total)&#x02014;including two that characterized expression within normal breast cells. Importantly, we also used our genomic findings to guide laboratory&#x02010;based experiments that together provide a detailed characterization of how dysregulation of cell adhesion pathways in high&#x02010;risk women may modulate cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;ECM properties, as well as differential responses to changes in these interactions. Such integrative approaches are imperative for deciphering mechanisms that influence disease risk.</p><p>Summarizing genomic data at the pathway level allows data to be placed in biological context and facilitates experimental follow&#x02010;up. However, one challenge with pathway&#x02010;based bioinformatics analyses is that many candidate pathways typically emerge. We addressed this issue by examining five genomic data sets to identify themes that were common across them. Importantly, many of the pathways we identified reflect similar biological processes. Subsequent laboratory&#x02010;based assays supported our genomic findings and further implicated cell adhesion pathways as being dysregulated in high&#x02010;risk patient tissues. These findings demonstrate the value of leveraging multiple pathways, cohorts, tissue types, and data types in studies with small or moderate sample size to identify functional dysregulation associated with a given phenotype&#x02014;in this case, familial breast cancer.</p><p>Although we focused primarily on cell adhesion as a candidate susceptibility mechanism, additional biological processes performed consistently well across our genomic analyses&#x02014;in particular, pathways that are known to play diverse roles in tumor development (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"msb156506-fig-0002\" ref-type=\"fig\">2</xref>A and <xref rid=\"msb156506-sup-0001\" ref-type=\"supplementary-material\">Appendix&#x000a0;Table&#x000a0;S2</xref>). These pathways regulate processes such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and the cell cycle and include well&#x02010;known cancer genes such as <italic>ERBB2</italic>,<italic> EGFR</italic>,<italic> PIK3CA</italic>, and <italic>JUN</italic>. These observations also are consistent with a recent prospective study that showed enrichment of cancer (and cell adhesion) pathways in blood&#x02010;derived DNA methylation profiles for women who developed familial breast cancer (Xu <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0082\" ref-type=\"ref\">2013</xref>). Together, our findings suggest that aberrant signaling within cancer pathways in peripheral blood may be a sign of eventual tumor development in general.</p><p>In this study, we focused on women who had at least two&#x02010;first&#x02010;degree relatives who had been diagnosed with cancer. Such women have a considerably higher risk of developing breast cancer than women who have only a single affected first&#x02010;degree relative. However, our findings may also have relevance for the latter group. Future studies will be valuable in assessing whether our findings are relevant mainly to women who have a relatively strong family history of breast cancer or to a broader population.</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that cell adhesion&#x02010;related pathways may exhibit different behavior between individuals who develop FBC and those who do not. Our evaluations of gene expression levels and germline variants across multiple cohorts identify an association between aberrant activity within these pathways and breast cancer susceptibility. The use of multi&#x02010;omic data linked to functional and biological studies complements conventional approaches, such as genomewide association studies, to aid in identifying signaling networks that influence disease development. These findings may lead to improved methods of predicting the development of familial breast cancer, which could have significant implications for risk management.</p></sec><sec id=\"msb156506-sec-0010\"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id=\"msb156506-sec-0011\"><title>Patient cohorts and ethics approval</title><p>As summarized in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"msb156506-tbl-0001\" ref-type=\"table-wrap\">1</xref> and <xref rid=\"msb156506-tbl-0002\" ref-type=\"table-wrap\">2</xref> and <xref rid=\"msb156506-sup-0001\" ref-type=\"supplementary-material\">Appendix&#x000a0;Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>, we acquired blood samples for a cohort of 124 women from Utah, USA.

Across our two cohorts, 30% of participants carried a known pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. We labeled the remaining participants who had a family history of breast cancer but who did not carry a known pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 as &#x0201c;BRCAX&#x0201d;. Across the cohorts, 47% of participants had developed breast cancer, whereas the remaining participants had not developed breast cancer by at least 55&#x000a0;years of age; the median age among these women was 60&#x000a0;years. The samples showed no statistical difference in age at blood draw.</p><p>To control for confounding effects due to previous cancer treatments, our control group included 41 women from Utah and 13 women from Ontario who had no family history of breast cancer. Over half of these women had developed non&#x02010;familial (sporadic) breast cancer (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"msb156506-tbl-0001\" ref-type=\"table-wrap\">1</xref> and <xref rid=\"msb156506-tbl-0002\" ref-type=\"table-wrap\">2</xref>). We included these cases to provide confidence that gene expression differences were specific to FBC and driven primarily by germline susceptibility factors and not prior cancer treatment.</p><p>The Utah women were recruited via Huntsman Cancer Institute (High Risk Breast Cancer Clinic) under Institutional Review Board protocols (#00022886 and #00004965). We selected these women from among a larger pool of eligible participants who had a strong family history of breast cancer, based on whether we could obtain fresh blood cells at the time of recruitment.

In addition, 63 patients from the Utah cohort responded to a health assessment survey that collected the following variables for each participant: age at diagnosis, age of first menstrual cycle, time since last menstrual cycle, age when menstruation ceased, level of education, religious preference, overall health status, marital status, level of physical activity, use of contraceptives, total number of pregnancies, first live birth age, last live birth age, number of live births, breastfeeding status, use of chemopreventive/hypertension/anti&#x02010;inflammatory drugs, tobacco use, alcohol use, occupational history, and history of immunological disorders.

Additionally, we excluded variants that occurred in more than 15% of the Utah samples but had not been excluded in prior steps. The preceding two steps reduced the number of SNVs and InDels by 18.4% and 90.8%, respectively.</p><p>Next, we excluded variants that fell outside exons (plus/minus two bases to allow for splice site mutations) used in each gene\\'s primary transcript; gene/transcript definitions were extracted from&#x000a0;<italic>Entrez Gene</italic>.

We excluded any missense SNV called as &#x0201c;neutral.&#x0201d; The remaining variants constituted our final set of &#x0201c;potentially pathogenic&#x0201d; variants. For simplicity, heterozygous variants and homozygous rare variants were considered to have an equivalent effect; 99.5% of these variants were heterozygous.</p><p>After filtering, we observed 6,908 variants (average of 182.1 SNVs and 15.3 InDels per sample) at 5,551 loci. Most variants were non&#x02010;synonymous substitutions (<xref rid=\"msb156506-sup-0001\" ref-type=\"supplementary-material\">Appendix&#x000a0;Fig S2</xref>).

The average transition/transversion ratio was 2.20. Most InDels resulted in a net gain/loss of three nucleotides or fewer; however, some were larger.</p><p>To assess the validity of our variant calls, we compared against the PCR&#x02010;based, commercial genetic test results for <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>. We observed only one false&#x02010;negative variant (rs80358061), which resides in a <italic>BRCA1</italic> intronic region outside the splice site junction points. Our pipeline identified this variant, but it was filtered out due to its intronic location. Five false&#x02010;positive variants occurred, but in all cases except one, the false&#x02010;positive variant coincided with another <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> variant in the same patient. Thus, for 94.2% of the samples, <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation status was identified correctly via exome sequencing.</p><p>Although processing the TCGA data required substantial computational resources, we emphasize its importance. By processing these samples using the same pipeline that we used to process our own samples, we avoided systematic biases that can arise due to differences in variant&#x02010;calling pipelines. Consequently, we identified variants/genes that were mutated frequently but that had not been identified in other databases we queried.</p></sec><sec id=\"msb156506-sec-0014\"><title>Pathway&#x02010;based analytic approaches</title><p>Using the PBMC gene expression data, we identified biological pathways that showed the greatest differences in expression between women who developed FBC and women who had a family history of breast cancer but who did not develop a tumor (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"msb156506-fig-0001\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>A). We obtained gene lists for 932 biological pathways from: (i) <italic>KEGG</italic> (Kanehisa <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0025\" ref-type=\"ref\">2006</xref>) (accessed on June 16, 2011), (ii) the Molecular Signatures Database (v3.0) (Subramanian <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0068\" ref-type=\"ref\">2005</xref>), and (iii) two research articles (Taube <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0070\" ref-type=\"ref\">2010</xref>; Byers <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0009\" ref-type=\"ref\">2013</xref>). For a given pathway, we made predictions in two successive steps: (i) we identified the most discriminatory genes from that pathway using the Support Vector Machines&#x02010;Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM&#x02010;RFE) algorithm (Guyon <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0019\" ref-type=\"ref\">2002</xref>) and then (ii) used the SVM classification algorithm (Vapnik, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0072\" ref-type=\"ref\">1998</xref>) to derive a probability that each patient had developed FBC. For the Utah individuals with a family history of breast cancer, we derived a probability for each sample in a ten&#x02010;fold cross&#x02010;validated design. We repeated this process for each pathway and ranked the pathways according to how accurately the SVM algorithm could distinguish women who developed FBC from women who had a family history of breast cancer but did not develop FBC (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;83, see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"msb156506-tbl-0001\" ref-type=\"table-wrap\">1</xref>). We considered the pathways for which we attained the highest classification accuracy to be most likely to play a role in FBC development (Pang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0049\" ref-type=\"ref\">2006</xref>; MacNeil <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0040\" ref-type=\"ref\">2015</xref>).</p><p>For the remaining samples, we estimated FBC status in a training/testing design. We trained an SVM model solely on the original 83 samples and predicted FBC status for the remaining samples, which included 60 Ontario women who had a family history of breast cancer, 28 of whom had developed breast cancer (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"msb156506-tbl-0002\" ref-type=\"table-wrap\">2</xref>). This set&#x000a0;also included data for 54 women from Utah or Ontario who did not have a family history of breast cancer, 30 of whom had developed sporadic breast cancer. After ranking the genes via SVM&#x02010;RFE (using only the training data), we derived SVM classification models for the top 25, 50, 75, 100, 125&#x02026;300 ranked genes. The number of genes that performed best within the Utah data was then used for the training/testing analysis. The derived probabilities were then compared against FBC status, and an AUC value was calculated using the ROCR package (Sing <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0061\" ref-type=\"ref\">2009</xref>). In this context, the AUC quantifies the model\\'s ability to discriminate the groups at various probability thresholds; it can be interpreted as the frequency that the model would assign two randomly selected patients to the correct group. Finally, we derived a <italic>P</italic>&#x02010;value for each pathway by comparing the AUC observed for that pathway against AUCs observed after randomly shuffling the class labels (1,000 permutations); these empirical <italic>P</italic>&#x02010;values represent the fraction of permuted AUCs higher than the non&#x02010;permuted AUCs.</p><p>We filtered these results further by excluding pathways for which the SVM predictions differed significantly (two sample <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;test, <italic>P</italic>&#x02010;value&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) between (i) individuals who had a family history of breast cancer but did not develop a tumor and (ii) individuals who did not have a family history of breast cancer (irrespective of whether they developed a tumor). This filtering step helped to ensure that the pathway&#x02010;level differences we observed were specific to FBC development and were not merely a result of treatment effects.</p><p>Subsequently, we applied the above approach to the Lim <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic> and Bellacosa <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic> data except that we used leave&#x02010;one&#x02010;out cross&#x02010;validation within each data set. In addition, because we did not know which patients would eventually develop breast cancer, we compared patients with a family history of breast cancer and/or a BRCA1/2 variant against those who did not have these characteristics. Although it is not certain that individuals with a family history of breast cancer and/or a highly penetrant variant will eventually develop cancer, these individuals have a much higher risk than the remaining population (Stratton &#x00026; Rahman, <xref rid=\"msb156506-bib-0066\" ref-type=\"ref\">2008</xref>).</p><p>For the DNA variant data, we aggregated variants at the gene and pathway levels. If a given sample carried any potentially pathogenic variant in a given gene or pathway, we considered that gene or pathway to be &#x0201c;mutated&#x0201d;; samples that contained a variant in a given gene carried an average of 1.02 variants in that gene. Under the assumption that frequently mutated genes are unlikely to drive susceptibility due to selective pressure and thus constitute noise at the pathway level, we excluded genes that are mutated relatively frequently. For this step, we used the germline samples from TCGA. Based on gene mutation frequencies in the TCGA data, we excluded genes from our data set that were mutated in more than 1.8% of TCGA germline samples (aside from <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>). We selected this threshold based on the maximal difference in the number of excluded genes for candidate thresholds that fell between 0.2% and 10% (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"msb156506-fig-0004ev\" ref-type=\"fig\">EV4</xref>). The number of &#x0201c;mutated&#x0201d; pathways was an average of 31 per patient (Fig&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"msb156506-fig-0003ev\" ref-type=\"fig\">EV3</xref>).

This cohort included reduction mammoplasty cells from women who lacked a family history of breast cancer and normal cells obtained via prophylactic surgery for women who had a family history of breast cancer.

We seeded the first set of cells into multi&#x02010;well slide chambers (Lab&#x02010;Tek II CC2 Slide, 8 chambers) and grew them in MEBM basal media supplemented with a MEGM BulletKit (Lonza) for 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days. We grew the second set of cells in STEMGENT WIT&#x02010;P media for 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;days. Cells were fixed (3.7% formaldehyde, 15&#x000a0;min), permeabilized (0.5% Triton X&#x02010;100, 5&#x000a0;min), and stained for F&#x02010;actin (Alexa Fluor 568&#x02013;phalloidin 1:150 [Molecular Probes]), focal adhesions (vinculin mouse antibody V&#x02010;9131 1:1,000 (Sigma) with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;anti&#x02010;mouse 1:200), and nuclei (Dapi 0.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Sigma). Cell images were captured with a Zeiss AxioCamMRm camera on a Zeiss Axioskop2 mot plus microscope (40&#x000d7; dry objective, 0.75 NA) using Zeiss AxioVision 4.8.1 software. Normal primary cells from each of 24 patient cell cultures were captured and analyzed in a blinded manner.

First, we estimated cell size by calculating the percent of the field area covered by cells and dividing by the estimate number of nuclei per field. To identify the field area covered by cells, we converted the layered images to an 8&#x02010;bit format, enhanced the color contrast, binarized, and then closed and filled features (see <xref rid=\"msb156506-sup-0019\" ref-type=\"supplementary-material\">Computer Code EV1</xref> for macro commands). We estimated the number of nuclei in Dapi fields using a similar approach but also applied the &#x0201c;Find Edges&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Watershed&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Find Particles&#x0201d; commands. As a measure of cellular density, we calculated the Euclidean distance between the centers of each nucleus pair and identified the three shortest inter&#x02010;nucleus distances in each field. Finally, we estimated the proportion of cell area covered by phalloidin or vinculin by subtracting background noise, enhancing, and binarizing the images that reflect these stains; we then divided these values by the overall estimated cell area per field. For each of the metrics, we evaluated differences between all observations across the groups using two&#x02010;sided <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;tests.</p></sec><sec id=\"msb156506-sec-0018\"><title>Cell adhesion assays</title><p>We assessed the cells&#x02019; adhesiveness to the extracellular membrane <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>.

We plated 3,000 cells from single&#x02010;cell suspensions per well, and the average number of viable cells adhering to the plate after three hours across the replicates was compared against total cell counts of viable cells after 14&#x000a0;h, using the CellTiter&#x02010;Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega).

We seeded 4,000 cells per well for each patient sample in 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of media and in 96&#x02010;well plates. Cells for a total of 31 patients (15 from prophylactic surgeries and 16 from breast reduction patients) were seeded. After 24&#x000a0;h, the cells were treated with PF573228 (0.16&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M/ml), and viability was quantified after 96&#x000a0;h using MTT (Sigma&#x02010;Aldrich, MO, USA).

After 24&#x000a0;h, we added afatinib and gefitinib. We chose the indicated doses&#x000a0;within the average linear range of drug effect: afatinib (10&#x000a0;nM&#x02013;1&#x000a0;mM) and gefitinib (0.001&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;mM). We used a BIOMEK 3000 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) robot to seed the cells and dispense the drugs. After 96&#x000a0;h, cell viability was quantified using the CellTiter&#x02010;Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). We calculated the proportion of viable cells for each dosage by comparing against cell counts for non&#x02010;treated cells. We then calculated a summary value for each cell line as the slope of a linear regression line fitted to the cell count proportions.</p></sec><sec id=\"msb156506-sec-0020\"><title>Western blot assays</title><p>Protein was extracted from either breast tissue chunks or pleural effusions.

studies that have described risk factors that influence tumor development. Such risk factors include genetic risk alleles and expression levels for individual genes (Miki et\\xa0al, 1994; Wooster et\\xa0al, 1994). However, breast tumorigenesis arises from a complex interplay among genes within signaling pathways. When one or more components of a given network are disrupted, cells may have a greater propensity to transform, proliferate, and invade surrounding tissue (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2011). Importantly, dysregulation of different genes within the same pathway may have a similar impact on downstream pathway function (Yarden & Sliwkowski, 2001; Wood et\\xa0al, 2007). Accordingly, to gain a broader perspective of the molecular aberrations that contribute to tumor development, it is valuable to evaluate data at the pathway level rather than evaluating single genes. Furthermore, by evaluating pathway activity using multiple types of “omic” data—including both DNA variation and gene expression changes—it is possible to develop a more complete picture of disease mechanisms. In addition, by examining pathway dysregulation in normal cells, one can better understand the processes by which germline variation leads to tumorigenesis; such effects should be observable not only in normal mammary epithelial cells but also in peripheral blood cells, which can be obtained less invasively (Liew et\\xa0al, 2006; Mohr & Liew, 2007).\\n\\nWe hypothesized that by comparing molecular profiles for women from high‐risk families who have developed breast cancer against women from high‐risk families who have not developed breast cancer, we might identify biological pathways that play a role in development of familial breast cancer (FBC). In addition, we hypothesized that transcriptomic profiling—summarized at the pathway level—would enable us to account for common downstream effects of different germline variants across many women who develop FBC. In other words, even though individuals who develop FBC may differ in the specific germline variants that they carry, those variants may affect similar signaling networks and have similar downstream transcriptional consequences.\\n\\nTranscriptional profiling has been used widely to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer phenotypes (Miller et\\xa0al, 2005; Bild et\\xa0al, 2006; Huang et\\xa0al, 2007; Langenau et\\xa0al, 2007; Rhodes et\\xa0al, 2007; Liu et\\xa0al, 2008; Waddell et\\xa0al, 2008; Wong et\\xa0al, 2008; Barbie et\\xa0al, 2009; Ooi et\\xa0al, 2009; Singh et\\xa0al, 2009; Zhang et\\xa0al, 2009). In normal cells, gene expression levels reflect functional germline genetic (and epigenomic) variation and thus may be useful as a surrogate for germline variation. Associations between genetic and transcriptomic variation were initially mapped in yeast where it was shown that genetic variants in parental yeast influence expression traits in progeny (Steinmetz et\\xa0al, 2002). Subsequent studies have identified thousands of expression quantitative trait loci in the human genome (Morley et\\xa0al, 2004; Schadt et\\xa0al, 2008), and additional research has demonstrated that global mRNA expression patterns can reflect heritable disease susceptibility (Mohr & Liew, 2007; Cookson et\\xa0al, 2009). For example, in individuals who carry BRCA1/2 mutations, expression patterns in lymphoblastoid cells are distinct from those in individuals who do not carry these mutations (Waddell et\\xa0al, 2008). Such downstream effects have also been observed in tumors (Hedenfalk et\\xa0al, 2001), suggesting that gene expression levels can reflect germline variation.\\n\\nWe performed a gene expression analysis to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in two patient cohorts that included women who had a family history of breast cancer; approximately half of these women had developed breast cancer, while the others had not. We also examined germline DNA variation in a subset of these samples to test for consistency of pathway dysregulation across these genomic data types. To study the biological mechanisms of FBC, we mapped the data to 932 canonical signaling pathways (Subramanian et\\xa0al, 2005; Kanehisa et\\xa0al, 2006; Taube et\\xa0al, 2010; Byers et\\xa0al, 2013) and used these data to discover pathway‐specific patterns that differed between individuals who developed FBC and those who did not. Multiple pathways related to cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion showed significant differences in gene expression and germline variation. Next, to verify whether these observations generalize to breast tissue, we performed a pathway analysis on two gene expression data sets that profiled normal breast tissue from women who had a family history of breast cancer and/or carried a mutation in BRCA1/2 and compared them against control women from the same studies. Again, various cell adhesion pathways attained statistical significance in these data sets. Based on these findings, we used cell‐based functional assays and fluorescence microscopy to compare cell adhesion properties of normal mammary epithelial cells between women who had undergone prophylactic mastectomy due to a breast cancer family history and women who had undergone a breast reduction surgery for reasons unrelated to breast cancer risk (these served as controls).\\n\\nIn support of our genomic findings, we observed significant differences in cell–cell and cell–ECM phenotypes for the prophylactic mastectomy cells compared with the controls. Specifically, normal cells from FBC women showed: (i) decreased cell adhesion abilities, (ii) increased cell death when treated with drugs that modulate cell adhesion capacity, and (iii) aberrant morphological features. Taken together, these findings, derived from multiple computational and experimental analyses on multiple tissue types, implicate dysregulated cell adhesion pathways in FBC development.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nOverview of approach to identify familial breast cancer susceptibility pathways by multi‐omic profiling\\n\\nOur initial analyses aimed to identify pathways that differed between women who developed FBC and those who did not, across multiple types of omic data. Because germline variation drives transcriptional changes that should be observable in both peripheral blood cells and breast cells, we obtained gene expression data for PBMCs and normal breast cells across four independent cohorts (Fig\\xa01B and C). We also obtained exome‐sequencing data for a subset of the PBMC samples to identify pathway‐level germline DNA variation associated with FBC development. We analyzed the omic data using pathway‐based approaches, identifying pathways that consistently showed dysregulation between women who were or were not affected by FBC (Fig\\xa01A). In this sense, our genomic data enabled us to generate and filter hypotheses regarding biological processes that play a role in FBC development; we then validated these findings in the laboratory using cell‐based assays (Fig\\xa01C).\\n\\nFigure 1 Flow chart illustrating the experimental design of this studyWe used pathway‐based analytic approaches to identify biological processes that may be disrupted in women who develop familial breast cancer (FBC). Having collected genomewide data, we filtered the data to include only genes associated with a given pathway. For each pathway, we identified differences between individuals who developed FBC and those who did not, using either the Support Vector Machines algorithm (gene expression data) or Barnard's exact test (DNA variant data). We considered the most statistically significant pathways to be candidates for further investigation.We profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells using gene expression microarrays and exome sequencing and identified pathways that were consistently significant across these data sets. To reduce the chance that our findings were influenced by treatment effects, we excluded pathways that showed significant differences between familial and non‐familial controls.For the remaining pathways, we identified those that showed significant differences in two gene expression data sets representing primary mammary epithelial cells. To validate these findings, we used cell‐based assays and fluorescence microscopy to profile an additional collection of normal breast cells.\\n\\n\\nPathway‐level evaluations of peripheral blood cells for women from breast cancer families\\n\\nFor patients from Utah (USA) and Ontario (Canada), we used gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to identify signaling pathways differentially expressed between women who developed FBC and women who had a family history of breast cancer but who did not develop cancer by at least age 55. We also sequenced the exomes of 35 Utah patients and assessed whether pathway‐level germline variation differed between these patient groups. For the expression data, we mapped gene‐level values to 932 curated signaling pathways and used the Support Vector Machines algorithm (Vapnik, 1998) to test how well a\\xa0multigene classifier—based only upon genes from a given pathway—could differentiate between women who developed FBC and women who did not. Pathways were ranked according to their accuracy at distinguishing FBC women versus controls (Fig\\xa01A). For mutation data, we compared the number of FBC samples that contained a variant in a given pathway against the number of\\xa0control samples with a pathway variant (see Materials and Methods).\\n\\nUsing the Utah data as a training set and the Ontario data as a test set, we focused on the 45 pathways that consistently and significantly discriminated between affected FBC women and controls for both cohorts and for both types of omic data (rank P‐value\\xa0<\\xa00.05; Dataset EV1). Because many canonical pathways reflect similar biological functions, we manually categorized the pathways according to biological themes that describe their activity (Appendix\\xa0Table\\xa0S2). As shown in Fig\\xa02A, the most significant cancer‐related biological themes were cell adhesion, MAPK signaling, and cell cycle regulation (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2011). Figure\\xa02B and C shows gene expression and DNA mutation patterns for the two pathways that performed best overall in these analyses (Datasets EV2, EV3 and EV4). The REACTOME Integrin Cell Surface Interactions pathway (P\\xa0=\\xa00.004) characterizes interactions that occur between ECM macromolecules and cell surface proteins to provide a substrate for epithelial cells (Faull & Ginsberg, 1996). The KEGG Small Cell Lung Cancer pathway (P\\xa0=\\xa00.005) characterizes various biological processes that can influence tumorigenesis—including cell–ECM interactions, cell proliferation, and cell cycle regulation. Various other pathways related to cell\\xa0adhesion—including KEGG Focal Adhesion (P\\xa0=\\xa00.012) and REACTOME Cell Surface Interactions at the Vascular Wall (P\\xa0=\\xa00.007)—also performed well in our analyses. Together, these\\xa0findings suggest that perturbation of normal cell adhesion activity may lead to an increased risk of breast tumors in FBC women.\\n\\nFigure 2 Overview of top pathways for which gene expression levels and mutation status differed significantly between FBC women and controls in the Utah and Ontario cohortsBiological processes associated with pathways that attained a rank P‐value\\xa0<\\xa00.05.Heatmaps show median expression levels for Utah and Ontario women, respectively, who developed FBC and for women who did not. Only genes that exhibited a consistent fold change across the cohorts are shown.Per‐sample DNA variants observed in these pathways are shown. Black dots indicate samples that carried a likely pathogenic in the genes that are shown. Only genes for which at least one variant was observed are shown.\\n\\nTo assess the robustness of these results, we repeated the pathway‐filtering steps using three alternative methods for combining P‐values across data sets (see Results) and then corrected for multiple tests using Storey's q‐value method (Storey, 2003). Each of these approaches resulted in a larger number of candidate pathways, and the same pathways that we had identified using the rank‐based approach were among the top pathways identified with these approaches (Datasets EV5, EV6 and EV7). Lastly, to further interrogate whether cell adhesion pathways were significant in specific patient subsets independently, we repeated the analyses but separated the data according to whether each patient carried a BRCA1/2 mutation or did not (BRCAX) (Appendix Figs S4 and S5). Comparing cancer vs. no cancer samples within each of these groups, we found that a variety of cell adhesion‐related pathways attained statistical significance (Dataset EV8 and EV9). Accordingly, although samples sizes are relatively small for these subgroup comparisons, these results suggest that cell adhesion processes may play a role in breast cancer risk for both groups. Because our overarching goal was to identify pathways that are common to and not specific to either BRCA1/2 or BRCAX carriers alone, we excluded any pathway that showed significant (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) differences between BRCA1/2 and BRCAX individuals (Dataset EV10 and EV11) from further analysis.To assess the robustness of these results, we repeated the pathway‐filtering steps using three alternative methods for combining P‐values across data sets (see Results) and then corrected for multiple tests using Storey's q‐value method (Storey, 2003).

Dataset EV12 lists pathways that showed an ability to discriminate between (i) women who had a family history of breast cancer and/or carried a BRCA1/2 mutation and (ii) controls in these data sets. Of the 45 pathways identified in the previous analysis, 9 showed significant differences for these two data sets as well as when combining evidence across all 5 data sets\\xa0(P‐value\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Again, the highest ranking pathways were REACTOME Integrin Cell Surface Interactions (P\\xa0=\\xa00.038 for Lim et\\xa0al and P\\xa0=\\xa00.030 for Bellacosa et\\xa0al) and KEGG Small Cell Lung\\xa0Cancer (P\\xa0=\\xa00.007 and 0.003, respectively) (Fig\\xa03; Datasets EV13, EV14, EV15 and EV16). Thus, expression patterns in these pathways for both peripheral blood and normal breast cells were remarkably consistent, again highlighting the potential role of cell adhesion signaling in FBC susceptibility. Although pathway perturbation mechanisms may vary from one individual to the next, our results consistently point to disrupted cell adhesion mechanisms as an indicator of breast cancer risk.\\n\\nFigure 3 Summary of pathway‐level results that included non‐FBC controls and normal breast gene expression dataCross‐validated estimates that each patient from the Lim et\\xa0al and Bellacosa et\\xa0al cohorts had a family history of breast cancer and/or carried a BRCA1/2 mutation. These estimates were derived from genes in the REACTOME Integrin Cell Surface Interactions pathway.Estimates for the same patients using genes from the KEGG Small cell lung cancer pathway.Data information: The boxes represent the the interquartile range of the “Genomic model score” values. The whiskers extend the the most extreme data points.\\n\\nTo further evaluate the relationship between gene expression and protein levels, we performed a Western blotting analysis using snap‐frozen tissue from an independent cohort of breast epithelial tissues that consisted of women undergoing prophylactic surgeries for BRCA1/2 mutation and/or high‐risk status and for controls who underwent breast reduction surgeries for non‐cancer‐related reasons (n\\xa0=\\xa027). Similar to the gene expression data, vitronectin (VTN) showed a significant increase in protein levels, while F‐actin showed a significant decrease for FBC women compared to controls (P‐value\\xa0<\\xa00.05), indicating that gene and protein expression for a subset of genes highlighted in the genomic analyses described above are concordantly dysregulated. Furthermore, FAK/PTK2 and PTEN protein levels trended lower in FBC patient samples compared to controls (Fig\\xa0EV1, Appendix\\xa0Table\\xa0S3).\\n\\nFigure EV1 Western blots of selected proteinsCell lysates obtained from cultures of primary mammary epithelial cells for women having normal breast reduction (control) or prophylactic breast reduction (high‐risk women) surgeries were immunoblotted with FAK (PTK2), ITGA6, ICAM2, p53, PTEN, ITGA IV, ITGA V, VTN, F‐actin, and β‐actin (loading control). Two lysates were loaded to each gel to compare between blots. Sample names shown in black are from high‐risk women; sample names shown in blue are from normal breast reduction samples; sample names shown in red are from breast reduction normal controls placed on every gene to serve as internal loading/processing controls.\\n\\n\\nAberrant cell morphology in normal mammary epithelial cells of women from FBC families\\n\\nAs our gene expression and DNA mutation analyses consistently indicated cell adhesion pathways as a candidate mechanism contributing to FBC, we investigated whether differences in cell adhesion phenotypes would be observable in normal breast tissue. Previous studies have associated cell adhesion perturbations and dysregulation of ECM components with breast tumorigenesis (Schor et\\xa0al, 1985; Weaver et\\xa0al, 1996, 1997, 2002; Schor & Schor, 2001; Wang et\\xa0al, 2002; Paszek et\\xa0al, 2005; Kass et\\xa0al, 2007; Levental et\\xa0al, 2009; Tanner et\\xa0al, 2012); however, these pathways have not previously been linked to breast cancer susceptibility. Accordingly, we used normal mammary epithelial cells—obtained after prophylactic mastectomies from women who had a family history of breast cancer—and compared them to cells from control women who underwent breast reduction surgeries. We tested whether cell–cell and cell–ECM phenotypes differed between the groups. Irrespective of surgery type, all patient samples were processed using similar procedures. Cold ischemia times were on average <\\xa030\\xa0min, and growth conditions for these viable tissues were the same for both surgical procedures.\\n\\nFirst, we asked whether we could detect qualitative differences in cytoskeletal cell–cell adhesion phenotypes. Normal primary mammary epithelial cells from 24 patient cultures were seeded onto glass slides, grown for 3–5\\xa0days, then fixed, stained, and imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Figure\\xa04A shows cells stained for F‐actin, focal adhesions, and nuclei from ten of the patients, which had been assessed in a blinded manner for having distinctive cell phenotypes. Cell morphology ranged from compact clusters of tightly bunched cells to dispersed single cells with well‐developed actin cytoskeletons and adhesion sites. After unblinding, we found that the control cell cultures more frequently clustered together and displayed actin filaments and focal adhesions that resemble typical observations for normal mammary epithelial cell cultures; however, many of the FBC cultures exhibited larger, well‐spread cells with more visible actin cytoskeletons and fewer cell–cell contacts. We quantified these observations (see Results) for all microscope fields (n\\xa0=\\xa0~10) from the 10 patients identified above and observed significant differences (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) between the groups in estimated cell size, F‐actin staining, and focal adhesion staining (Fig\\xa04B).\\n\\nFigure 4 Fluorescence microscopy images of primary breast epithelial cultures for FBC women and controlsPrimary (non‐malignant) mammary epithelial cells from breast reduction patients with no known family history of breast cancer and from prophylactic mastectomy patients who had a breast cancer family history (“high risk”) were cultured on glass slides for 3–5\\xa0days and subsequently fixed and stained for F‐actin (red, phalloidin), focal adhesions (green, vinculin) and nuclei (blue, Dapi). Shown are five cell populations (two fields each) from each group that had been identified in a blinded manner as having distinctive cell phenotypes. Scale bar\\xa0=\\xa050\\xa0μm.Box\\xa0plots showing the results of quantitative comparisons for all microscope fields (n\\xa0=\\xa0˜10) from each of the samples shown. Samples from high‐risk patients were more spread apart and expressed higher levels of F‐actin. See Results for details about how quantitative metrics were derived. The boxes represent the the interquartile range of the respective values. The whiskers extend the the most extreme data points.\\n\\n\\nAberrant cell adhesion properties in normal mammary epithelial cells of women from FBC families\\n\\nTo further evaluate the functional role of cell adhesion in FBC, we used an in\\xa0vitro assay to assess the cells’ ability to adhere. We allowed the mammary epithelial cell cultures to adhere to laminin‐coated plates for three hours to test for cell–ECM interaction and adherence. We then quantified the number of cells that adhered to the plates and observed a modest but significant decrease in adherent cells for FBC samples compared to controls (Fig\\xa05A, P‐value\\xa0=\\xa00.02), again supporting the findings from our genomic studies. Of note, the adhesion phenotype observed within the primary cultures may be time‐in‐culture dependent, as we did not see a difference in focal adhesions for FBC cells grown longer term in culture, which is consistent with our fluorescence microscopy observations. This subtle variance suggests that differences in cell–ECM adherence may be observable in short‐term culture acute settings but may be compensated for, and lost, in longer term culture experiments.\\n\\nFigure 5 Cell‐based assays show aberrant cell adhesion in normal breast epithelial cells for women with a high risk of breast cancerA cell adhesion assay was used to compare extracellular matrix adhesiveness in normal, primary breast cells in women who did or did not have a family history of breast cancer. Cells from women who had a family history of breast cancer were significantly less adherent than cells from women who did not have a family history of breast cancer.A drug‐response assay was used to evaluate responsiveness to PF573228, a FAK inhibitor in μm concentrations. Normal, breast epithelial cells were obtained from high‐risk women who had undergone prophylactic surgery and compared against cells from women who had undergone non‐risk‐related, breast reduction surgery. The prophylactic samples were significantly more sensitive to PF573228 than breast reduction samples. Response values indicate the drug concentration that induces a response that reaches half of its maximal effect.Data information: The boxes represent the the interquartile range of the respective values. The whiskers extend the the most extreme data points.\\n\\n\\nPharmacological evidence for aberrant cell adhesion properties in normal breast epithelial cells of FBC women\\n\\nWe treated breast epithelial cells with PF573228, a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor (Slack‐Davis et\\xa0al, 2007), as FAK (PTK2) is critical in focal adhesions that form among cells attaching to the extracellular matrix, as well as in cell migration. If normal epithelial cells from FBC women are “primed” with decreased cell adhesion, then inhibiting FAK in these cells would potentially have increased potency when compared to control cells. We found that cells from FBC patients were significantly more sensitive than controls to this drug (Fig\\xa05B), suggesting that there are deficits in adhesion properties in FBC patient cells and indicating a role of FAK‐related signaling and the actin cytoskeleton in FBC development.\\n\\nAs a control experiment, we assessed cell proliferation when cells from the same cultures were treated with gefitinib and afatinib, which target growth factor‐related pathways but are not closely related to cell adhesion, but we saw no difference in response for these growth control drugs (Fig\\xa0EV2).\\n\\nFigure EV2 Gefitinib and afatinib assay resultsA, B Primary breast cells were treated with the (A) EGFR inhibitor gefitinib and (B) tyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinib. Similar responses were observed for women who had a family history of breast cancer and for women who did not have a family history of breast cancer. The boxes represent the the interquartile range of the respective values. The whiskers extend the the most extreme data points.\\n\\nIn sum, our in silico and in\\xa0vitro observations suggest that alterations to cell adhesion regulatory pathways may lead to distinct cell phenotypes in women with a family history of breast cancer, that these alterations may lead to decreased cell–cell contact disposition in response to growth and that this functional mechanism may play a role in FBC development.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nSince the discovery of BRCA1 and BRCA2 as breast cancer susceptibility genes (Miki et\\xa0al, 1994; Wooster et\\xa0al, 1994), much focus has been placed on discovering additional DNA variants that are associated with FBC development. Ongoing efforts to genotype ever‐larger cohorts have also yielded common susceptibility variants (Michailidou et\\xa0al, 2013); however, in total, known susceptibility variants explain <\\xa030% of familial risk (Stratton & Rahman, 2008). Accordingly, new complimentary approaches are needed to identify genomic factors that drive FBC risk. In our study, we took a multi‐omic approach and searched for multigene patterns associated with FBC development, irrespective of BRCA1/2 mutation status. Our approach is based on the premise that germline genetic and epigenomic variations cause gene expression changes in normal cells that reflect a person's risk for eventual tumor development. Upon examining gene expression levels and protein‐coding variants for women who did or did not develop FBC, we identified signaling pathways with consistent differences between the groups, including pathways related to cell adhesion, integrin signaling, and growth signaling. We also evaluated normal breast cells using fluorescence microscopy, functional assays, and pharmacologic assays; each provided additional evidence that cell adhesion pathways are dysregulated in high‐risk women. These findings complement prior research, which has shown that blood‐derived molecular signatures reflect dysregulated molecular processes in breast tissue (Sharma et\\xa0al, 2005; Aarøe et\\xa0al, 2010; Tudoran et\\xa0al, 2014), that dysregulation of cell adhesion genes can be identified in blood cells from breast cancer patients (Tudoran et\\xa0al, 2014), and that germline variants in cell adhesion pathway genes contribute to breast cancer risk (Ayala et\\xa0al, 2003; Langsenlehner et\\xa0al, 2006; Liu et\\xa0al, 2013). Our analysis extends these observations by aggregating pathway‐level genomic data from four independent patient populations (five data sets total)—including two that characterized expression within normal breast cells. Importantly, we also used our genomic findings to guide laboratory‐based experiments that together provide a detailed characterization of how dysregulation of cell adhesion pathways in high‐risk women may modulate cell–cell and cell–ECM properties, as well as differential responses to changes in these interactions. Such integrative approaches are imperative for deciphering mechanisms that influence disease risk.\\n\\nSummarizing genomic data at the pathway level allows data to be placed in biological context and facilitates experimental follow‐up. However, one challenge with pathway‐based bioinformatics analyses is that many candidate pathways typically emerge. We addressed this issue by examining five genomic data sets to identify themes that were common across them. Importantly, many of the pathways we identified reflect similar biological processes. Subsequent laboratory‐based assays supported our genomic findings and further implicated cell adhesion pathways as being dysregulated in high‐risk patient tissues. These findings demonstrate the value of leveraging multiple pathways, cohorts, tissue types, and data types in studies with small or moderate sample size to identify functional dysregulation associated with a given phenotype—in this case, familial breast cancer.\\n\\nAlthough we focused primarily on cell adhesion as a candidate susceptibility mechanism, additional biological processes performed consistently well across our genomic analyses—in particular, pathways that are known to play diverse roles in tumor development (Fig\\xa02A and Appendix\\xa0Table\\xa0S2). These pathways regulate processes such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and the cell cycle and include well‐known cancer genes such as ERBB2, EGFR, PIK3CA, and JUN. These observations also are consistent with a recent prospective study that showed enrichment of cancer (and cell adhesion) pathways in blood‐derived DNA methylation profiles for women who developed familial breast cancer (Xu et\\xa0al, 2013). Together, our findings suggest that aberrant signaling within cancer pathways in peripheral blood may be a sign of eventual tumor development in general.\\n\\nIn this study, we focused on women who had at least two‐first‐degree relatives who had been diagnosed with cancer. Such women have a considerably higher risk of developing breast cancer than women who have only a single affected first‐degree relative. However, our findings may also have relevance for the latter group. Future studies will be valuable in assessing whether our findings are relevant mainly to women who have a relatively strong family history of breast cancer or to a broader population.\\n\\nOverall, our results suggest that cell adhesion‐related pathways may exhibit different behavior between individuals who develop FBC and those who do not. Our evaluations of gene expression levels and germline variants across multiple cohorts identify an association between aberrant activity within these pathways and breast cancer susceptibility. The use of multi‐omic data linked to functional and biological studies complements conventional approaches, such as genomewide association studies, to aid in identifying signaling networks that influence disease development. These findings may lead to improved methods of predicting the development of familial breast cancer, which could have significant implications for risk management.\\n\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\n\\nPatient cohorts and ethics approval\\n\\nAs summarized in Tables\\xa01 and 2 and Appendix\\xa0Table\\xa0S1, we acquired blood samples for a cohort of 124 women from Utah, USA. Additionally, we recruited an independent cohort of 73 women from Ontario, Canada. Our objective was to determine whether pathway dysregulation in non‐malignant cells correlates with the development of breast cancer in individuals who had a family history of breast cancer, with or without a BRCA1/2 mutation. Individuals who had a family history of breast cancer but had not developed cancer, or who did not have a family history but either had, or had not, developed cancer, served as controls. Accordingly, both the Utah and Ontario cohorts included women who (i) had a family history of breast cancer or did not, (ii) carried a pathogenic germline variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 or did not, and (iii) had developed breast cancer or had not. Our definition of “family history of cancer” was limited to women who had at least two‐first‐degree relatives who had been diagnosed with cancer. Where possible, patients were matched according to age at which blood was drawn (see Table\\xa01 and Appendix\\xa0Fig S1). For individuals who had developed breast cancer, blood samples were collected at least 6\\xa0months after completing therapy.\\n\\nTable 1\\nFamily history of breast cancer\\tBRCA1/2 mutation\\tDeveloped tumor\\t# Patients\\tMedian age\\nYes\\t16\\t59\\nYes\\tNo\\tYes\\t23\\t59\\nYes\\tNo\\t18\\t60\\nYes\\tNo\\t26\\t63\\nNo\\tYes\\t22\\t66\\nNo\\t19\\t58\\n\\nTable 2\\nFamily history of breast cancer\\tBRCA1/2 mutation\\tDeveloped tumor\\t# Patients\\nYes\\t11\\nYes\\tNo\\tYes\\t17\\nYes\\tNo\\t14\\nYes\\tNo\\t18\\nNo\\tYes\\t8\\nNo\\t5\\n\\nPathogenic mutation status in BRCA1/2 was identified via commercial, PCR‐based genetic testing (Myriad Genetics). Technical\\xa0specifications for these tests can be found here: https://www.myriad.com/lib/technical-specifications/BRACAnalysis-Technical-Specifications.pdf. Across our two cohorts, 30% of participants carried a known pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. We labeled the remaining participants who had a family history of breast cancer but who did not carry a known pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 as “BRCAX”. Across the cohorts, 47% of participants had developed breast cancer, whereas the remaining participants had not developed breast cancer by at least 55\\xa0years of age; the median age among these women was 60\\xa0years. The samples showed no statistical difference in age at blood draw.\\n\\nTo control for confounding effects due to previous cancer treatments, our control group included 41 women from Utah and 13 women from Ontario who had no family history of breast cancer. Over half of these women had developed non‐familial (sporadic) breast cancer (Tables\\xa01 and 2). We included these cases to provide confidence that gene expression differences were specific to FBC and driven primarily by germline susceptibility factors and not prior cancer treatment.\\n\\nThe Utah women were recruited via Huntsman Cancer Institute (High Risk Breast Cancer Clinic) under Institutional Review Board protocols (#00022886 and #00004965). We selected these women from among a larger pool of eligible participants who had a strong family history of breast cancer, based on whether we could obtain fresh blood cells at the time of recruitment. The Ontario women were recruited through the Breast Cancer Family Registry at Mt. Sinai Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.\\n\\n\\nGene expression data\\n\\nIn accordance with manufacturer (Becton‐Dickinson) protocol, PBMCs were isolated from blood samples in cell preparation tubes. RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST microarrays.\\n\\nWe normalized the microarray data using the Single‐channel Array Normalization method (Piccolo et\\xa0al, 2012). Next, we excluded any microarray probe that overlapped with a known DNA variant or that was not classified as “green” in PLANdbAffy (Nurtdinov et\\xa0al, 2010). We used a 10% trimmed mean to summarize the remaining probes at the gene level and excluded genes with four probes or fewer. We used ComBat (Johnson et\\xa0al, 2007) to correct for any batch effects; because some Ontario samples were processed at two different facilities, we treated these samples as two separate batches.\\n\\nWe also excluded any gene whose expression might be confounded by immune activity or demographic/clinical variables associated with the patients. We applied a total lymphocyte enumeration test to whole blood cells for 22 samples from the Utah cohort to estimate the number of B cells, CD3‐positive T cells, CD4‐positive T cells, CD8‐positive T cells, and NK cells. In addition, 63 patients from the Utah cohort responded to a health assessment survey that collected the following variables for each participant: age at diagnosis, age of first menstrual cycle, time since last menstrual cycle, age when menstruation ceased, level of education, religious preference, overall health status, marital status, level of physical activity, use of contraceptives, total number of pregnancies, first live birth age, last live birth age, number of live births, breastfeeding status, use of chemopreventive/hypertension/anti‐inflammatory drugs, tobacco use, alcohol use, occupational history, and history of immunological disorders. We used a multifactor ANCOVA test to identify genes (n\\xa0=\\xa0334) for which gene expression levels correlated strongly with any of these factors (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01).\\n\\nWe used normal breast tissue expression data from Lim et\\xa0al (Lim et\\xa0al, 2009) (GSE17072) and Bellacosa et\\xa0al (2010) (GSE19383). Using data preprocessed by the original authors, we compared gene expression levels between women who had a family history of breast cancer and/or who carried a pathogenic mutation in BRCA1/2 and control patients who did not meet these criteria.\\n\\n\\nExome‐sequencing data\\n\\nWe used exome‐capture DNA sequencing to profile peripheral blood cells from 35 of the Utah participants. Genomic DNA was hybridized using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon v4\\xa0+\\xa0UTRs kits. Captured libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hi‐Seq 2000 instrument, and bar coding was used for multiplexing (seven lanes, five samples per lane). This process resulted in 101‐bp paired‐end reads (58,032,900 unique reads per sample).\\n\\nWe aligned raw sequencing reads to the hg19 reference genome using the Burrows‐Wheeler Aligner software (BWA, version 0.6.1) (Li & Durbin, 2009). We marked duplicate reads using Picard tools (v. 1.82, http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) and sorted and indexed reads using samtools (v.\\xa00.1.18) (Li et\\xa0al, 2009). Using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, v. 2.3.4) (Depristo et\\xa0al, 2011), we passed the data through various processing steps to realign and recalibrate the reads and to detect SNVs and short InDels; we\\xa0followed the relevant GATK Best Practice Variant Detection guide.\\n\\nOn average per sample, 5,848,610,129 bases aligned to the reference genome, and 88.24% of bases fell within exome‐capture target regions, resulting in a mean target coverage of 58.10. This level of coverage was considerably higher, for example, than the 20× coverage required for quality control in the TCGA breast cancer study (Koboldt et\\xa0al, 2012).\\n\\nAcross all samples, we observed DNA variants at 941,507 unique loci (830,317 single nucleotide variants [SNVs] and 111,190 short insertion/deletion variants [InDels]). We used multiple criteria to filter the initial variants (Fig\\xa0EV3). We excluded any variant for which a minor allele frequency greater than one percent (Cirulli & Goldstein, 2010) had been reported in any ethnic population in either the 1000 Genomes (phase 1, release 3) (Abecasis et\\xa0al, 2012) or Exome Sequencing Project 6500 data (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS).\\n\\nFigure EV3 Overview of criteria used to filter exome‐sequencing variantsVariants were filtered based on frequency, location within protein‐coding regions, conservation, and effect on protein sequence. Variants were also collapsed to gene‐level values before pathway‐level comparisons were performed. All statistics listed on this diagram are per sample.\\n\\nBecause variant calls are often discordant across sequencing technologies and analytical pipelines (O'Rawe et\\xa0al, 2013), we used our variant‐calling pipeline to process 611 germline DNA samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that had been profiled via exome sequencing, and we excluded samples that had a minor allele frequency greater than 3%—a higher threshold was used for TCGA because this population may be enriched for susceptibility variants. Additionally, we excluded variants that occurred in more than 15% of the Utah samples but had not been excluded in prior steps. The preceding two steps reduced the number of SNVs and InDels by 18.4% and 90.8%, respectively.\\n\\nNext, we excluded variants that fell outside exons (plus/minus two bases to allow for splice site mutations) used in each gene's primary transcript; gene/transcript definitions were extracted from\\xa0Entrez Gene. The remaining variants were annotated for protein‐coding effect using snpEff (Cingolani et\\xa0al, 2012). We excluded variants that were assigned a severity level of “MODIFIER” or “LOW.” We retained any variant that was assigned a “HIGH” severity; these consisted primarily of truncating, frameshift, and splice site variants. We also retained “MODERATE” InDels. We examined nonsynonymous coding SNVs for evolutionary conservation and functional effect using the SIFT (Kumar et\\xa0al, 2009), Polyphen‐2 (Adzhubei et\\xa0al, 2013), and MutationAssessor (Reva et\\xa0al, 2011) algorithms (obtained via dbNSFP (Liu et\\xa0al, 2011) and aggregated them using Condel (Gonzalez‐Perez et\\xa0al, 2012)). We excluded any missense SNV called as “neutral.” The remaining variants constituted our final set of “potentially pathogenic” variants. For simplicity, heterozygous variants and homozygous rare variants were considered to have an equivalent effect; 99.5% of these variants were heterozygous.\\n\\nAfter filtering, we observed 6,908 variants (average of 182.1 SNVs and 15.3 InDels per sample) at 5,551 loci. Most variants were non‐synonymous substitutions (Appendix\\xa0Fig S2). The most frequent substitutions were G‐to‐A and C‐to‐T transitions (Appendix\\xa0Fig S3). The average transition/transversion ratio was 2.20. Most InDels resulted in a net gain/loss of three nucleotides or fewer; however, some were larger.\\n\\nTo assess the validity of our variant calls, we compared against the PCR‐based, commercial genetic test results for BRCA1 and BRCA2. We observed only one false‐negative variant (rs80358061), which resides in a BRCA1 intronic region outside the splice site junction points. Our pipeline identified this variant, but it was filtered out due to its intronic location. Five false‐positive variants occurred, but in all cases except one, the false‐positive variant coincided with another BRCA1/2 variant in the same patient. Thus, for 94.2% of the samples, BRCA1/2 mutation status was identified correctly via exome sequencing.\\n\\nAlthough processing the TCGA data required substantial computational resources, we emphasize its importance. By processing these samples using the same pipeline that we used to process our own samples, we avoided systematic biases that can arise due to differences in variant‐calling pipelines. Consequently, we identified variants/genes that were mutated frequently but that had not been identified in other databases we queried.\\n\\n\\nPathway‐based analytic approaches\\n\\nUsing the PBMC gene expression data, we identified biological pathways that showed the greatest differences in expression between women who developed FBC and women who had a family history of breast cancer but who did not develop a tumor (Fig\\xa01A). We obtained gene lists for 932 biological pathways from: (i) KEGG (Kanehisa et\\xa0al, 2006) (accessed on June 16, 2011), (ii) the Molecular Signatures Database (v3.0) (Subramanian et\\xa0al, 2005), and (iii) two research articles (Taube et\\xa0al, 2010; Byers et\\xa0al, 2013). For a given pathway, we made predictions in two successive steps: (i) we identified the most discriminatory genes from that pathway using the Support Vector Machines‐Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM‐RFE) algorithm (Guyon et\\xa0al, 2002) and then (ii) used the SVM classification algorithm (Vapnik, 1998) to derive a probability that each patient had developed FBC. For the Utah individuals with a family history of breast cancer, we derived a probability for each sample in a ten‐fold cross‐validated design. We repeated this process for each pathway and ranked the pathways according to how accurately the SVM algorithm could distinguish women who developed FBC from women who had a family history of breast cancer but did not develop FBC (n\\xa0=\\xa083, see Table\\xa01). We considered the pathways for which we attained the highest classification accuracy to be most likely to play a role in FBC development (Pang et\\xa0al, 2006; MacNeil et\\xa0al, 2015).\\n\\nFor the remaining samples, we estimated FBC status in a training/testing design. We trained an SVM model solely on the original 83 samples and predicted FBC status for the remaining samples, which included 60 Ontario women who had a family history of breast cancer, 28 of whom had developed breast cancer (Table\\xa02). This set\\xa0also included data for 54 women from Utah or Ontario who did not have a family history of breast cancer, 30 of whom had developed sporadic breast cancer. After ranking the genes via SVM‐RFE (using only the training data), we derived SVM classification models for the top 25, 50, 75, 100, 125…300 ranked genes. The number of genes that performed best within the Utah data was then used for the training/testing analysis. The derived probabilities were then compared against FBC status, and an AUC value was calculated using the ROCR package (Sing et\\xa0al, 2009). In this context, the AUC quantifies the model's ability to discriminate the groups at various probability thresholds; it can be interpreted as the frequency that the model would assign two randomly selected patients to the correct group. Finally, we derived a P‐value for each pathway by comparing the AUC observed for that pathway against AUCs observed after randomly shuffling the class labels (1,000 permutations); these empirical P‐values represent the fraction of permuted AUCs higher than the non‐permuted AUCs.\\n\\nWe filtered these results further by excluding pathways for which the SVM predictions differed significantly (two sample t‐test, P‐value\\xa0<\\xa00.05) between (i) individuals who had a family history of breast cancer but did not develop a tumor and (ii) individuals who did not have a family history of breast cancer (irrespective of whether they developed a tumor). This filtering step helped to ensure that the pathway‐level differences we observed were specific to FBC development and were not merely a result of treatment effects.\\n\\nSubsequently, we applied the above approach to the Lim et\\xa0al and Bellacosa et\\xa0al data except that we used leave‐one‐out cross‐validation within each data set. In addition, because we did not know which patients would eventually develop breast cancer, we compared patients with a family history of breast cancer and/or a BRCA1/2 variant against those who did not have these characteristics. Although it is not certain that individuals with a family history of breast cancer and/or a highly penetrant variant will eventually develop cancer, these individuals have a much higher risk than the remaining population (Stratton & Rahman, 2008).\\n\\nFor the DNA variant data, we aggregated variants at the gene and pathway levels. If a given sample carried any potentially pathogenic variant in a given gene or pathway, we considered that gene or pathway to be “mutated”; samples that contained a variant in a given gene carried an average of 1.02 variants in that gene. Under the assumption that frequently mutated genes are unlikely to drive susceptibility due to selective pressure and thus constitute noise at the pathway level, we excluded genes that are mutated relatively frequently. For this step, we used the germline samples from TCGA. Based on gene mutation frequencies in the TCGA data, we excluded genes from our data set that were mutated in more than 1.8% of TCGA germline samples (aside from BRCA1/2). We selected this threshold based on the maximal difference in the number of excluded genes for candidate thresholds that fell between 0.2% and 10% (Fig\\xa0EV4). The number of “mutated” pathways was an average of 31 per patient (Fig\\xa0EV3). We used a one‐way Barnard's exact test (Barnard, 1945) to compare pathway‐level mutation rates between individuals who developed FBC and those who did not. In cases where we sought to identify pathways whose mutation rates differed between BRCA1/2 and BRCAX individuals, we applied this test once in each direction.\\n\\nFigure EV4 Selection of threshold used to filter frequently mutated genesGenes that were mutated in a relatively high number of germline samples in TCGA were excluded from the pathway‐level mutation analyses. We calculated the number of genes that would be excluded for thresholds ranging between 0.2% and 10%. A threshold of 1.8% was selected based on the maximal difference in number of excluded genes.\\n\\nWhen combining evidence across these various data sets, we used the rankPvalue function in the WGCNA package (Langfelder & Horvath, 2008) to determine which pathways had a consistently low ranking, using P‐value order within each data set for the rankings. Accordingly, although the P‐value distributions differed across the analyses, the relative performance of each pathway was taken into account. We tested three alternative methods for combining P‐values as implemented in the metap package (version 0.6; http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metap). These included Fisher's combined probability test, Wilkinson's method, and the “sum p” method (Fisher, 1932; Wilkinson, 1951; Edgington, 1972). For each of these methods, we corrected for multiple tests using Storey's q‐value method (version 2.0.0) (Storey, 2003).\\n\\n\\nCorrelation between sequencing variants and gene expression\\n\\nFor 34 samples that were profiled using both gene expression microarrays and DNA sequencing, we estimated the relationship between gene mutation status and expression of the same gene using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Using a local false discovery rate approach (Strimmer, 2008), we determined a threshold at which to reject the null hypothesis that gene mutation status was not correlated with expression levels of that gene. Fig\\xa0EV5 illustrates the relationship between germline variant status and gene expression levels for 373 genes that showed the strongest association between these data types.\\n\\nFigure EV5 Relationship between variant status and gene expression for 34 samples profiled using gene expression microarrays and exome sequencingWe sought to identify genes whose expression levels correlated strongly with mutation status. This figure shows data for 373 genes that exhibited the strongest association between the presence of one or more potentially pathogenic variants and expression of the same gene. Red dots indicate samples that carried a mutation within a given gene. Gray dots indicate samples that did not carry a mutation within the same gene. In many cases, germline variants are correlated with a considerable increase or decrease of expression levels for the same gene. Expression values for each gene are standardized to a consistent scale for illustration purposes.\\n\\n\\nPatient samples for in\\xa0vitro assays\\n\\nWe collected additional primary mammary epithelial cells for 51 total patients from Utah. This cohort included reduction mammoplasty cells from women who lacked a family history of breast cancer and normal cells obtained via prophylactic surgery for women who had a family history of breast cancer. Family history status was determined via examination of medical health records. Different patients were used for each assay described below, due to limited amounts of tissue available after surgeries. Informed consent was obtained for all participants.\\n\\n\\nFluorescence microscopy\\n\\nWe examined cell morphology using fluorescence microscopy in a blinded manner. We seeded the first set of cells into multi‐well slide chambers (Lab‐Tek II CC2 Slide, 8 chambers) and grew them in MEBM basal media supplemented with a MEGM BulletKit (Lonza) for 3–5\\xa0days. We grew the second set of cells in STEMGENT WIT‐P media for 1–2\\xa0days. Cells were fixed (3.7% formaldehyde, 15\\xa0min), permeabilized (0.5% Triton X‐100, 5\\xa0min), and stained for F‐actin (Alexa Fluor 568–phalloidin 1:150 [Molecular Probes]), focal adhesions (vinculin mouse antibody V‐9131 1:1,000 (Sigma) with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488–anti‐mouse 1:200), and nuclei (Dapi 0.3\\xa0μM). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Sigma). Cell images were captured with a Zeiss AxioCamMRm camera on a Zeiss Axioskop2 mot plus microscope (40× dry objective, 0.75 NA) using Zeiss AxioVision 4.8.1 software. Normal primary cells from each of 24 patient cell cultures were captured and analyzed in a blinded manner. Microscope images were processed using Adobe Photoshop v.8 and Illustrator CS v.11.\\n\\nWe used the Fiji (based on ImageJ from NIH) software (Schindelin et\\xa0al, 2012) to quantify features within the fluorescence images. First, we estimated cell size by calculating the percent of the field area covered by cells and dividing by the estimate number of nuclei per field. To identify the field area covered by cells, we converted the layered images to an 8‐bit format, enhanced the color contrast, binarized, and then closed and filled features (see Computer Code EV1 for macro commands). We estimated the number of nuclei in Dapi fields using a similar approach but also applied the “Find Edges”, “Watershed”, and “Find Particles” commands. As a measure of cellular density, we calculated the Euclidean distance between the centers of each nucleus pair and identified the three shortest inter‐nucleus distances in each field. Finally, we estimated the proportion of cell area covered by phalloidin or vinculin by subtracting background noise, enhancing, and binarizing the images that reflect these stains; we then divided these values by the overall estimated cell area per field. For each of the metrics, we evaluated differences between all observations across the groups using two‐sided t‐tests.\\n\\n\\nCell adhesion assays\\n\\nWe assessed the cells’ adhesiveness to the extracellular membrane in\\xa0vitro. We pre‐coated 96‐well plates overnight with 1\\xa0μg/ml human laminin (Millipore), which were washed in PBS prior to cell plating. We plated 3,000 cells from single‐cell suspensions per well, and the average number of viable cells adhering to the plate after three hours across the replicates was compared against total cell counts of viable cells after 14\\xa0h, using the CellTiter‐Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). We calculated all P‐values using a two‐sided t‐test.\\n\\n\\nDrug‐response assays\\n\\nThe FAK inhibitor PF573228 was purchased from Selleckchem and dissolved in 100% DMSO to generate 10\\xa0mM stock solutions of each. Stock solutions were stored at −80°C in aliquots. Human primary mammary epithelial cells were grown in MEBM basal media supplemented with MEGM Bullet (Lonza, NJ, USA). We seeded 4,000 cells per well for each patient sample in 100\\xa0μl of media and in 96‐well plates. Cells for a total of 31 patients (15 from prophylactic surgeries and 16 from breast reduction patients) were seeded. After 24\\xa0h, the cells were treated with PF573228 (0.16–20\\xa0μM/ml), and viability was quantified after 96\\xa0h using MTT (Sigma‐Aldrich, MO, USA). We calculated EC50 values for each patient sample using a nonlinear regression line fitted to drug response in GraphPad. Negative values were converted to zero prior to EC50 calculation.\\n\\nGefitinib and afatinib, both inhibitors of growth factor receptors, were used in additional cell‐based assays to test for differential response between cells from women who had a family history of breast cancer and those who did not. Specifically, we plated 1500\\xa0cells/well for each patient sample in 40\\xa0μl of MEBM basal media supplemented with a MEGM Bulletkit (Lonza), in half‐well 96‐well plates (Nunc), in triplicate for each drug dose. After 24\\xa0h, we added afatinib and gefitinib. We chose the indicated doses\\xa0within the average linear range of drug effect: afatinib (10\\xa0nM–1\\xa0mM) and gefitinib (0.001–0.5\\xa0mM). We used a BIOMEK 3000 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) robot to seed the cells and dispense the drugs. After 96\\xa0h, cell viability was quantified using the CellTiter‐Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). We calculated the proportion of viable cells for each dosage by comparing against cell counts for non‐treated cells. We then calculated a summary value for each cell line as the slope of a linear regression line fitted to the cell count proportions.\\n\\n\\nWestern blot assays\\n\\nProtein was extracted from either breast tissue chunks or pleural effusions. DEB lysis buffer (1% Triton X‐100, 150\\xa0mM NaCl, 50\\xa0mM Tris pH 8.0, 5\\xa0mM EDTA, 0.1%SDS) with protease (Roche Complete Mini) and phosphatase inhibitor (PhosSTOP, Roche) was used for cell/tissue lysis. A Bradford assay was performed to quantify protein content in each sample. Thirty micrograms of protein was loaded onto 4–12% gradient gels (Bio‐Rad) for separation by SDS–PAGE. As there was a large number of samples, three gels were run containing both FBC and control patient samples. For an internal control, two control patient samples were repeated in each gel. Protein was transferred to PVDF membranes, blocked with Superblock (Thermo scientific), and incubated with the following primary antibodies: β‐actin (Cell Signaling #3700, 1:2,000), F‐actin (Abcam #ab205, 1:500), vitronectin (Abcam #ab45139, 1:500), Integrin α4 (Cell Signaling #8440, 1:500), Integrin α5 (Cell Signaling #4705, 1:500), Integrin α6 (Cell Signaling #3750, 1:500), ICAM2 (Cell Signaling #13355, 1:500), p53 (Cell Signaling #2527, 1:500), PTEN (Cell Signaling #9552, 1:500), and FAK (Cell Signaling #13009, 1:1,000). Horseradish peroxidase that linked whole antibody from donkey (GE Healthcare NA934V) and sheep (GE Healthcare NXA931) was used as the secondary antibody. Prior to film exposure, blots were incubated with Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific) for 5\\xa0min. Blots were stripped using Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific) for re‐probing. Band quantification was done using the ImageJ software. The expression of proteins was compared with the expression of loading control (β‐actin).\\n\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\nWe used the Weka software package (SVMAttributeEval module) (Hall et\\xa0al, 2009) to execute SVM‐RFE. We configured it to remove 10% of genes in each iteration and to remove a single gene per iteration when <\\xa01% of genes remained. Otherwise, we used default configuration settings. We used the e1071 R package (http://cran.r-project.org/package=e1071) and LIBSVM library (Chang & Lin, 2011) for SVM classification. In deriving the models, we selected the radial basis function kernel and used nested cross‐validation to tune the C parameter. We used ML‐Flex (Piccolo & Frey, 2012) to execute these steps in parallel. We used the pROC package to calculate 95% confidence intervals for AUC values (Robin et\\xa0al, 2011).\\n\\nWe used the Python programming language (http://www.python.org) to parse and summarize data files, and a pre‐release version of the SCAN software for microarray normalization.\\n\\nSoftware scripts and code that were used to preprocess data and to filter and rank pathways can be accessed at https://github.com/srp33/BCRiskPathways.

Atmospheric venting of CH<sub>4</sub> from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) was recently reported to be on par with flux from the Arctic tundra; however, the future scale of these releases remains unclear. Here, based on results of our latest observations, we show that CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from this shelf are likely to be determined by the state of subsea permafrost degradation. We observed CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from two previously understudied areas of the ESAS: the outer shelf, where subsea permafrost is predicted to be discontinuous or mostly degraded due to long submergence by seawater, and the near shore area, where deep/open taliks presumably form due to combined heating effects of seawater, river run-off, geothermal flux and pre-existing thermokarst. CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from these areas emerge from largely thawed sediments via strong flare-like ebullition, producing fluxes that are orders of magnitude greater than fluxes observed in background areas underlain by largely frozen sediments. We suggest that progression of subsea permafrost thawing and decrease in ice extent could result in a significant increase in CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from the ESAS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>methane emissions</kwd><kwd>subsea permafrost</kwd><kwd>sea ice</kwd><kwd>East Siberian Arctic Shelf</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>October 13, 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id=\"s1\"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The Arctic seabed is believed to contain a significant pool of organic carbon and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) preserved within and beneath the subsea permafrost, including permafrost-related and continental slope CH<sub>4</sub> hydrates [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>]. Sustained CH<sub>4</sub> release to the atmosphere from thawing Arctic permafrost and dissociating hydrates were suggested to be positive and likely to be significant feedbacks to climate warming [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>]. Some authors believe that CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes from subsea permafrost, more than 80% of which occur in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), will depend on rates of CH<sub>4</sub> production in gradually thawing sediments [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>], while subsea permafrost will remain frozen for millennia [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Others believe that permafrost failure caused by long-lasting warming by seawater due to sea-level rise and global-change-induced warming, which in the twenty-first century is very pronounced over the ESAS [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>], will destabilize massive gas reservoirs, leading to large-scale CH<sub>4</sub> releases, including release of pre-formed CH<sub>4</sub> long preserved within and beneath subsea permafrost [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>].</p><p>Our ability to project future CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from the ESAS largely depends on understanding the relationship between existing CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes and environmental features that control these fluxes. CH<sub>4</sub> releasing to the water column could result from modern methanogenesis and/or could originate from seabed deposits (that is, accumulations of pre-formed CH<sub>4</sub>, preserved as free gas and/or hydrates) [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>]. CH<sub>4</sub>, produced within marine sediment and accumulated in the pore water as dissolved CH<sub>4</sub>, usually does not reach the water column because it is oxidized in the sulfate reduction zone; this does not apply to CH<sub>4</sub> releasing as bubbles, because biogeochemical filter is only effective on dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>]. In areas of the World Ocean where the organic carbon content of sediments is high or seawater is polluted with human waste, CH<sub>4</sub> production rates could exceed the capacity of the sulfate reduction zone and CH<sub>4</sub> could be released to the water column [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p><p>To attribute CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes to the current state of subsea permafrost, we aimed to assess the range of modern fluxes, observed over the entire area of the ESAS and compare these rates with the current state of subsea permafrost in different areas of the ESAS. To do so, we needed to evaluate fluxes from earlier underestimated areas such as outer shelf with water depth more than 50&#x02009;m, where permafrost has presumably degraded the most according to modelling results, because it was submerged by seawater &#x02248;10&#x02013;15&#x02009;000 years ago at the beginning of the Holocene [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. If this assumption about the current state of subsea permafrost were true, CH<sub>4</sub> flux from these areas would represent the maximum possible CH<sub>4</sub> flux in the ESAS and indicate the potential for flux increase if ESAS permafrost thawing progresses. Another fraction of the ESAS that lacked our attention previously was the near shore area that was inundated most recently (less than 1000 years ago).</p><p>Most recently developed subsea permafrost models, which incorporated sediment salinity, parametrized unfrozen water content and the influence of preceding thermokarst (that is, the hummocky landscape left behind when ice-rich permafrost melts), have shown that taliks (that is, layers or columns of thawed sediments within permafrost), developed over the ESAS at the beginning of the Holocene, might not have frozen after their submergence by seawater [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>]. Thus, we included one such area in our investigation (Ivashkina Lagoon), where some authors suggested the existence of a deep talik before inundation [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. Because the water column in the ESAS is very shallow (mean depth approx. 50&#x02009;m), it provides a very short path for bubble-transported CH<sub>4</sub> to escape to the atmosphere. However, in deeper waters, a significant fraction of bubbles will dissolve and remain in the water column. Turnover time of dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> will depend on rates of oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. As the residence time of seawater on the ESAS shelf could be shorter than the turnover time of dissolved CH<sub>4</sub>, it could be transported laterally to other parts of the Arctic Ocean (AO). Therefore, it is important to elucidate the fate of dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> in the ESAS.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2\"><label>2.</label><title>Study area and methods</title><sec id=\"s2a\"><label>(a)</label><title>Study area</title><p>This study covered two areas of the ESAS (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"RSTA20140451F1\">figure 1</xref>): the ice-free area of the Laptev Sea (between 76.5&#x02013;77.5&#x000b0;&#x02009;N and 121&#x02013;132&#x000b0;&#x02009;E, water depth between 50 and 165&#x02009;m, total area (<italic>S</italic>) of approx. 6400&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup>, polygon 1, P1), and the near shore area in the southeastern part of the Laptev Sea (between 71&#x02013;74&#x000b0;&#x02009;N and 129&#x02013;131&#x000b0;&#x02009;E, water depth less than 20&#x02009;m, total area approx. 2500&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup>, polygon 2, P2).

A specific feature of the ESAS is that during the winter, about 10% of the shelf area is composed of open water (and young ice off the land-fast ice) or polynyas, which are parts of the Great Siberian Polynya [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>].

Bubbles usually escape via venting holes on the sea floor, which may or may not be surrounded by bacterial mats. In this research, we define seep as an area on the sea floor where CH<sub>4</sub> releases from a single bubble-sized vent (electronic supplementary material, figure S1); such bubbles create a single-track image on acoustic echograms [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. In places, bubbles release as a vigorous flow that often reach the sea surface; on echograms, such bubble plumes create specific flare-like images. Seeps could exhibit sparse occurrence on the sea floor or could be observed as relatively large and dense areas, where numerous single-bubble seeps occur (seep field); when a seep field includes flares, we define such an area a flare seep field. To detect, map, monitor and analyse seep fields in summer 2011, a multi-channel hydro-acoustic complex was designed using one hull-mounted ELAC single-beam echo sounder and two Sargan echo sounders on the RV Academician Lavrent\\'ev with triple-frequency 12, 20 and 135&#x02009;kHz transducers covering 12&#x000b0;, 10&#x000b0; and 4&#x000b0; beam width, respectively. In summer 2012, sonar data were gathered using a SIMRAD EK15 SW 1.0.0 echo sounder (<uri xlink:href=\"www.simrad.com\">www.simrad.com</uri>) with 200&#x02009;kHz operational frequency, 80&#x02013;1240&#x02009;&#x003bc;s pulse duration, 26&#x000b0; beam width and built-in calibration system. Seep and flare-imaging data were recorded at an average survey speed of 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;knots. The backscattered signal was digitally recorded, visualized and processed using an original software package provided by SIMRAD EK 15 (E<sc>cho</sc>V<sc>iew</sc> and S<sc>onar5</sc>). The backscattering strength of the bubbles was measured at a frequency of 200&#x02009;kHz with a pulse length of 1&#x02009;ms repeated every 100&#x02009;ms. To measure the bubble screen backscattering strength, the acoustic sensors were calibrated using a target provided by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2d\"><label>(d)</label><title>Visual and hydro-acoustical observation of bubbles</title><p>Bubbles were observed during calm weather conditions using a submerged cabled remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with a high-speed high-resolution video camera.

To resist currents and stabilize video recording and camera operation, the ROV was attached to the Rosette frame. The Rosette equipped with Niskin bottles was deployed to the sea floor and left in place for about 1&#x02009;h, which allowed bubble sampling and bubble image recording, followed by statistical treatment of records.

To interpret sonar data, we performed an <italic>in situ</italic> calibration using a method described in detail in [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Calibration aimed to establish a relationship between the backscattering strength of CH<sub>4</sub> bubbles and gas flux rate. Results achieved by use of <italic>in situ</italic> calibration were validated by comparing these results with estimates obtained based on direct <italic>in situ</italic> observations of CH<sub>4</sub> bubble flow.</p><p>Implementation of this approach included a few steps. First, we detected areas of seep fields within the studied area using single-beam sonar. Then, we classified these seep fields by area size and strength of the backscattering signal recorded by sonar. After that, we focused on detailed surveys of randomly chosen seep fields to evaluate the number of individual seeps in each seep field. Several such seeps, in which bubbles were distinctly emitted from the seafloor one by one, were chosen for continuing observation to obtain bubble sizes and rates of bubble release per unit of time. For each seep, mean CH<sub>4</sub> flux was calculated by multiplying mean bubble volume (assuming 100% CH<sub>4</sub> content) by mean bubble release rate observed during the time of observation. Finally, we assessed bubble-induced CH<sub>4</sub> flux using the results of <italic>in situ</italic> sonar calibration of sonar data (electronic supplementary material, figure S3).</p><p>For calibration, we used nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) as a calibration gas (40&#x02009;l volume, 460&#x02009;atm). The tank was installed on the foredeck of our research vessel. PVC pipe, 12&#x02009;mm in diameter, 6&#x02009;mm wall thickness, 70&#x02009;m long, was attached to Kevlar wire with a heavy metal load (about 30&#x02009;kg) on the end and was deployed to a depth of 40&#x02009;m where the water depth was 45&#x02009;m. The multi-beam and single-beam sonars were located near each other so that their beam coverage overlapped, but the centre points of the beam diagrams focused on the bubble stream produced using a copper nozzle 4&#x02009;mm in diameter attached to the end of the PVC pipe. Gas flux was tuned using a standard flow meter. One port of a flow meter was connected to a PVC pipe, the second port was connected to the gas tank through the gas reduction system, which consisted of one high-pressure sensor to measure the pressure remaining in the tank and one low-pressure sensor to measure the emitted pressure (5.5&#x02009;atm). Gas flow changed from 0.5 to 150&#x02009;l&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Measurements started after the gas flow stabilized and lasted about 10&#x02009;min for each session. We conducted eight sessions in the chosen location. No natural seepages occurred in this place and the sea floor was almost flat, excluding (or at least reducing) the possibility of scattering from the bottom. Wind during the sessions was 1&#x02013;3&#x02009;m&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and there were almost no waves. Conductivity&#x02013;temperature&#x02013;depth (CTD) data were obtained for the site using an SBE19plus CTD probe (USA). The vessel was anchored during the calibration session. <italic>In situ</italic> calibration of an operational system allowed the measured echo level of a known acoustically insonified bubble volume to be directly related to the bubble flux rate (electronic supplementary material, tables S1 and S2).

First, we established a relationship between seep field occurrence along the ship\\'s path and the area covered by a sonar beam in a single survey. To minimize uncertainty while establishing a correlation between backscatter value and seep occurrence, we performed in-depth investigation of a few seep fields in order to achieve the densest area coverage possible in particular field conditions (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). For example, in the 5.76&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup> F5 seep field, 2.3&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup> was actually insonified, which represents 40% of the total seep field area; in the 9.8&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup> F93 seep field, we achieved 13% coverage of the entire seep field area.

Another reason could be that when bubbles are released as large streams, they might interact with each other creating acoustical coupling; this could potentially decrease the sonar return signal (backscatter) [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>]. A number of uncertainties exist in the quantitative assessment of bubble-transported CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes, because the gas exchange between bubbles and water depends on bubble size, shape, bubble rise velocity as well as on varying properties of seawater [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>]. One such uncertainty springs from the fact that the ability of single-beam sonar to capture seeps outside the area covered by the beam is limited. To minimize this uncertainty, coverage of 13&#x02013;40% was achieved during in-depth studies of chosen seep fields (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Another uncertainty is related to the sporadic nature of seeps and flares, which causes high temporal variability of CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>]. When acoustic targets are highly concentrated (like bubbles in plumes), a shadowing effect might occur [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. To eliminate or minimize the shadowing effect, some authors [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>] have suggested using frequencies higher than 50&#x02009;kHz and calibrating the sonar system using gas emitted at known flux rates that was implemented in our study.</p><p>In October 2013, we performed observations in the southernmost part of P2 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"RSTA20140451F1\">figure 1</xref>), in Ivashkina Lagoon, which has been progressively inundated during the last approximately 100&#x02013;200 years, replacing a former thermokarst lake (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"RSTA20140451F3\">figure 3</xref>). The importance of this investigation is in that according to an existing assumption (which is one of the most important in permafrost modelling), submerged thermokarst lakes, which widely developed over the ESAS in the beginning of the Holocene, become frozen after submergence; therefore, no gas release should have occurred from that lagoon [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. Despite that assumption, we observed vigorous bubble release from narrow and steep depressions aligned parallel to the lagoon\\'s northern edge. Backscattering cross-sections of the bubbles emitted from 17 seeps observed in the Ivashkina Lagoon were recorded for 36&#x02009;h using portable single-beam sonar, which was calibrated <italic>in situ</italic> during the same campaign.

We drilled a hole in the sea ice and created an artificial seep at approximately 6&#x02009;m water depth as described above. A gas tank was installed on the fast ice. By tuning the valve (changing the pressure) installed on the gas tank head, bubble flow controlled by a flowmeter was changed from 0.2 to 2.0&#x02009;l&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> by creating a flow of approximately 5&#x02009;mm diameter bubbles. We captured these bubbles escaping from the water surface using a chamber installed over the hole in the sea ice. After 1&#x02009;h of exposure, we examined the composition of gas collected in the chamber and measured actual CH<sub>4</sub> flux from the water surface. Our data show that at a shallow water depth, approximately 67&#x02013;72% of CH<sub>4</sub> remains in the bubbles when the bubbles reach the sea surface (electronic supplementary material, table S3). This assessment is only applicable to shallow water depths; to assess the fraction of CH<sub>4</sub> that reaches the surface from deeper water, there is a need to perform additional investigations of bubble plume dynamics in the water column.</p></sec><sec id=\"s3e\"><label>(e)</label><title>Fate of methane released to the water column</title><p>How much of the CH<sub>4</sub> carried by bubbles will reach the sea surface and be released to the atmosphere largely depends on the CH<sub>4</sub> flux rate, water depth and <italic>in situ</italic> release conditions that control transfer processes [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>]. Most of the CH<sub>4</sub> dissolves in the water column, building up an aqueous CH<sub>4</sub> inventory. The fate of dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> largely depends on the interaction between a few factors: the turnover time of dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> in the water column, the stability of the water column against vertical mixing and the rates of turbulent diffusion and lateral advection. Dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> in the outer ESAS requires 300&#x02013;1000 days to be oxidized in the water column because CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation rates are very low (mean&#x000b1;1&#x02009;s.d.: 0.0988&#x000b1;0.1343&#x02009;nM&#x02009;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <italic>p</italic>=0.95, <italic>n</italic>=328).

Because the temperature in the Arctic has increased at twice the rate as in the rest of the globe, and the region is expected to increase an additional 8&#x000b0;C (14&#x000b0;F) in the twenty-first century [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>], longer periods of open water and shorter ice-covered periods [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>] are occurring. Increasing periods of open water implies an increasing number of storm events, when wind speed increases to 15&#x02009;m&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or more and the boundary between sea surface and air increases many times due to deep water mixing. Such events have the potential to rapidly ventilate bubble-transported and dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> from the water column, producing high emission rates to the atmosphere. Because more than 75% of the total ESAS area is less than 50&#x02009;m in depth, the water column provides bubbles with a very short conduit to the atmosphere. Storms enable more CH<sub>4</sub> release because they destroy shallow water stratification and increase the boundary between sea surface and air, thus increasing gas exchange across phase boundaries. As a result, bubble-mediated, storm-induced CH<sub>4</sub> &#x02018;pulses&#x02019; force a greater fraction of CH<sub>4</sub> to bypass aqueous microbial filters and reach the atmosphere [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>].</p><p>In addition, about 10% of the ESAS remains open water in winter due to formation of flaw polynyas. It was shown that flaw polynyas provide pathways for CH<sub>4</sub> escape to the atmosphere during the arctic winter [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C37\" ref-type=\"bibr\">37</xref>]. Areas of flaw polynyas in the ESAS increased dramatically (by up to five times) during the last decades, and now exceed the total area of the Siberian wetlands (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). This implies that the ESAS remains an active source of CH<sub>4</sub> to the atmosphere year-round. Increasing storminess [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>] and rapid sea-ice retreat [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>] causing increased CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes from the ESAS are possible new climate-change-driven processes. Continuing warming of the AO will strengthen these processes, and the role of the ESAS as a year-round contributor to global CH<sub>4</sub> emissions will grow over time.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4b\"><label>(b)</label><title>Implications for future emissions</title><p>These new data together with those obtained previously show very high variability of CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes in the ESAS. On the one hand, this points to a lack of established methods that can be used for quantitative assessment of fluxes, both diffusive and bubble-transported. Indeed, because the major driving parameter in calculations of diffusive fluxes is wind speed, adjustment of climatic winds to actual winds changed the estimated CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes by two orders of magnitude [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref>]. Quantitative derivation of bubble fluxes remains difficult because seep fields could include flares and a number of factors affect the seabed, water column and sea&#x02013;air fluxes [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>]. In the ESAS, the water column is very shallow and provides a very short path for bubble-transported CH<sub>4</sub> to the atmosphere. Because the ESAS is the largest shelf in the World Ocean, the development of methods applicable for estimating bubbling flux from large areas over a relatively short time (the period of open water in the Arctic) is very important. Among the methods used to date, the hydro-acoustical method described in [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>] and modified in this study seems to be most suitable for flux estimates over large areas rather than for localized <italic>in situ</italic> observations, which could be more area-specific. <italic>In situ</italic> calibration of an operational system allows the measured echo level of a known acoustically insonified bubble volume to be directly related to the bubble flux rate, reducing the number of system parameters that must be known.</p><p>On the other hand, these data support the hypothesis that variability of CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes is determined by the current state of subsea permafrost, which is undergoing destabilization caused by the long-lasting warming effect of inundation by seawater that started at the beginning of the Holocene. Indeed, in the ESAS, organic carbon (<italic>C</italic><sub>org</sub>) contents of sediments vary by only a factor of approximately 4, while CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes vary by orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"RSTA20140451F5\">figure 5</xref>). Such flux variability could be determined by many factors, including the deep geological structures; however, test results showed that when ice saturation is more than 80%, CH<sub>4</sub> gas can be completely sealed within the permafrost [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref>]. This means that when subsea permafrost is ice-bonded and continuous, it is virtually impermeable for mass transfer from geological sources beneath the permafrost [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. Therefore, the state of subsea permafrost is becoming a key factor controlling CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes from the seabed to the water column in the ESAS.\\n<fig id=\"RSTA20140451F5\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Distribution of total <italic>C</italic><sub>org</sub> in the surface sediments versus current state of subsea permafrost and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) fluxes from the sea floor/sea surface in the ESAS.

We suggest that within the entire range of observed fluxes, the lowest fluxes are associated with an initial degree of subsea permafrost thawing observed in the shallow shelf outside the areas affected by faults, rivers and pre-existing thermokarst. These fluxes are fuelled by modern methanogenesis occurring within sediment accumulations of the Holocene age, which have never been frozen, and/or within partially thawed older sediments beneath them. The highest rates observed over the outer shelf area are likely to represent the maximum emissions, which combine recently produced CH<sub>4</sub> and long-accumulated pre-formed CH<sub>4</sub> escaping from seabed deposits through gas migration pathways that are growing in capacity. Shallow hot spots, currently releasing CH<sub>4</sub> at high rates, are representative of local subsea permafrost disintegration that takes place in areas subjected to development of deep/open taliks due to increased fault-related geothermal flux and/or river heat-induced flux and/or thermokarst progression after submergence.</p><p>The observed range in CH<sub>4</sub> emissions associated with different degrees of subsea permafrost disintegration implies substantial and potent emission enhancement in the ESAS as the process of subsea permafrost thawing progresses with time. While it is still unclear how quickly CH<sub>4</sub> flux rates will change, the current process of Arctic warming and associated sea ice loss [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>] will accelerate this process. The potential for the release of substantial amounts of CH<sub>4</sub> from the ESAS region has important implications not only for atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations but also, given CH<sub>4</sub>\\'s potency as a greenhouse gas, for the global climate. Because the ESAS contains the largest and arguably most vulnerable stores of subsea CH<sub>4</sub> [<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>,<xref rid=\"RSTA20140451C47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref>], inclusion of the ESAS source in global climate models should be considered a high priority.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=\"supplementary-material\"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"SD1\"><caption><title>Supplementary Material includes Supplementary methods, Tables (S1-S3), Supplementary Figures (S1-S6) and Supplementary References (S1-S11)</title></caption><media mimetype=\"application\" mime-subtype=\"docx\" xlink:href=\"rsta20140451supp1.docx\" orientation=\"portrait\" id=\"d35e1408\" position=\"anchor\"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id=\"s5\"><title>Authors\\' contributions</title><p>N.S., I.S., Va.S., L.L., S.J. and O.D. designed the fieldwork; A.S., D.C., Vl.S. and D.K. set up the analytical instruments, performed the on-board measurements, collected the data and conducted quality control; D.C., V.Y. and A.S collected and analysed sonar data; Vl.S. performed microbiological experiments; G.P. performed data assimilation; N.S., D.K., D.C., G.P., A.S., A.C. and A.M. crafted the figures; N.S., I.S. and O.G. drafted the first manuscript; and all authors contributed to the final version.</p></sec><sec id=\"s6\"><title>Competing interests</title><p>We declare we have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id=\"s7\"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by the Russian Government (grant no. 2013-220-04-157 under contract no. 14, Z50.31.0012/03.19.2014); the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (nos. 13-05-12028, 13-05-12041, 13-05-12042, 13-05-12-29, grant no.

Sustained CH4 release to the atmosphere from thawing Arctic permafrost and dissociating hydrates were suggested to be positive and likely to be significant feedbacks to climate warming [4,5]. Some authors believe that CH4 fluxes from subsea permafrost, more than 80% of which occur in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), will depend on rates of CH4 production in gradually thawing sediments [6], while subsea permafrost will remain frozen for millennia [7]. Others believe that permafrost failure caused by long-lasting warming by seawater due to sea-level rise and global-change-induced warming, which in the twenty-first century is very pronounced over the ESAS [8], will destabilize massive gas reservoirs, leading to large-scale CH4 releases, including release of pre-formed CH4 long preserved within and beneath subsea permafrost [9,10].\\n\\nOur ability to project future CH4 emissions from the ESAS largely depends on understanding the relationship between existing CH4 fluxes and environmental features that control these fluxes. CH4 releasing to the water column could result from modern methanogenesis and/or could originate from seabed deposits (that is, accumulations of pre-formed CH4, preserved as free gas and/or hydrates) [11,12]. CH4, produced within marine sediment and accumulated in the pore water as dissolved CH4, usually does not reach the water column because it is oxidized in the sulfate reduction zone; this does not apply to CH4 releasing as bubbles, because biogeochemical filter is only effective on dissolved CH4 [13]. In areas of the World Ocean where the organic carbon content of sediments is high or seawater is polluted with human waste, CH4 production rates could exceed the capacity of the sulfate reduction zone and CH4 could be released to the water column [13].\\n\\nTo attribute CH4 fluxes to the current state of subsea permafrost, we aimed to assess the range of modern fluxes, observed over the entire area of the ESAS and compare these rates with the current state of subsea permafrost in different areas of the ESAS. To do so, we needed to evaluate fluxes from earlier underestimated areas such as outer shelf with water depth more than 50\\u2009m, where permafrost has presumably degraded the most according to modelling results, because it was submerged by seawater ≈10–15\\u2009000 years ago at the beginning of the Holocene [14]. If this assumption about the current state of subsea permafrost were true, CH4 flux from these areas would represent the maximum possible CH4 flux in the ESAS and indicate the potential for flux increase if ESAS permafrost thawing progresses. Another fraction of the ESAS that lacked our attention previously was the near shore area that was inundated most recently (less than 1000 years ago).\\n\\nMost recently developed subsea permafrost models, which incorporated sediment salinity, parametrized unfrozen water content and the influence of preceding thermokarst (that is, the hummocky landscape left behind when ice-rich permafrost melts), have shown that taliks (that is, layers or columns of thawed sediments within permafrost), developed over the ESAS at the beginning of the Holocene, might not have frozen after their submergence by seawater [15,16]. Thus, we included one such area in our investigation (Ivashkina Lagoon), where some authors suggested the existence of a deep talik before inundation [17]. Because the water column in the ESAS is very shallow (mean depth approx. 50\\u2009m), it provides a very short path for bubble-transported CH4 to escape to the atmosphere. However, in deeper waters, a significant fraction of bubbles will dissolve and remain in the water column. Turnover time of dissolved CH4 will depend on rates of oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. As the residence time of seawater on the ESAS shelf could be shorter than the turnover time of dissolved CH4, it could be transported laterally to other parts of the Arctic Ocean (AO). Therefore, it is important to elucidate the fate of dissolved CH4 in the ESAS.\\n\\n2.\\n\\n\\nStudy area and methods(a)\\n\\n\\nStudy area\\n\\nThis study covered two areas of the ESAS (figure 1): the ice-free area of the Laptev Sea (between 76.5–77.5°\\u2009N and 121–132°\\u2009E, water depth between 50 and 165\\u2009m, total area (S) of approx. 6400\\u2009km2, polygon 1, P1), and the near shore area in the southeastern part of the Laptev Sea (between 71–74°\\u2009N and 129–131°\\u2009E, water depth less than 20\\u2009m, total area approx. 2500\\u2009km2, polygon 2, P2). The former area was chosen as representative of the outer shelf, where permafrost thawing was suggested to be largely complete based on modelling results [14,16]. The latter area was assumed to be representative of the near shore zone affected by thermokarst, where the possible existence of taliks was suggested due to increased fault-related geothermal flux and/or river heat-induced flux and/or thermokarst progression after submergence [16]. New observational data were collected during three summer campaigns in September–October 2011, 2012 and 2013, and two winter surveys in April 2011 and 2012.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1. Study area. (a) Black rectangles mark the position of polygon 1 (P1, outer shelf) and polygon 2 (P2, near shore area); red circles show the position of discovered seep fields in the study area where hydro-acoustical investigations were performed: white stars mark the position of two seep fields (F5 and F93) where detailed surveys were performed; yellow circles show the position of oceanographic stations in the study area; green shows land; blue shows water; bathymetry lines are shown as black counters; (b) the red circle shows position of the Ivashkina Lagoon within P2.(b)\\n\\n\\nSea ice and polynyas\\n\\nAnalysis of datasets collected on sea ice extent (SIE) in the Siberian seas (1932–2005) revealed a significant SIE decrease during the entire period of observations: area-averaged mean monthly ice thickness in perennial ice pack in the basin decreased by 1.1\\u2009m (from 2.7–3.1\\u2009m to 1.4–1.9\\u2009m) [18]. Because ice thickness in the AO depends on air temperature and ice dynamics, it was suggested that the warming might most affect the thickness of the fast ice [19]. A specific feature of the ESAS is that during the winter, about 10% of the shelf area is composed of open water (and young ice off the land-fast ice) or polynyas, which are parts of the Great Siberian Polynya [20]. Followed by land-fast ice formation, polynyas develop in November when wind breaks apart the fast ice and the drifting sea ice propagates hundreds of kilometres offshore [21].\\n\\n(c)\\n\\n\\nSeep detection\\n\\nBubbles in the water column usually come from seeps on the sea floor and could be detected using backscattered images of bubbles because there is a pronounced acoustic impedance difference between water and bubbles [22]. Bubbles usually escape via venting holes on the sea floor, which may or may not be surrounded by bacterial mats. In this research, we define seep as an area on the sea floor where CH4 releases from a single bubble-sized vent (electronic supplementary material, figure S1); such bubbles create a single-track image on acoustic echograms [10]. In places, bubbles release as a vigorous flow that often reach the sea surface; on echograms, such bubble plumes create specific flare-like images. Seeps could exhibit sparse occurrence on the sea floor or could be observed as relatively large and dense areas, where numerous single-bubble seeps occur (seep field); when a seep field includes flares, we define such an area a flare seep field. To detect, map, monitor and analyse seep fields in summer 2011, a multi-channel hydro-acoustic complex was designed using one hull-mounted ELAC single-beam echo sounder and two Sargan echo sounders on the RV Academician Lavrent'ev with triple-frequency 12, 20 and 135\\u2009kHz transducers covering 12°, 10° and 4° beam width, respectively. In summer 2012, sonar data were gathered using a SIMRAD EK15 SW 1.0.0 echo sounder (www.simrad.com) with 200\\u2009kHz operational frequency, 80–1240\\u2009μs pulse duration, 26° beam width and built-in calibration system. Seep and flare-imaging data were recorded at an average survey speed of 4–6\\u2009knots. The backscattered signal was digitally recorded, visualized and processed using an original software package provided by SIMRAD EK 15 (EchoView and Sonar5). The backscattering strength of the bubbles was measured at a frequency of 200\\u2009kHz with a pulse length of 1\\u2009ms repeated every 100\\u2009ms. To measure the bubble screen backscattering strength, the acoustic sensors were calibrated using a target provided by the manufacturer.\\n\\n(d)\\n\\n\\nVisual and hydro-acoustical observation of bubbles\\n\\nBubbles were observed during calm weather conditions using a submerged cabled remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with a high-speed high-resolution video camera. During the ROV dives, several individual seep outlets were observed, in which bubbles were released distinctly one by one. Each outlet was observed in detail for 20\\u2009min to 1\\u2009h. To resist currents and stabilize video recording and camera operation, the ROV was attached to the Rosette frame. The Rosette equipped with Niskin bottles was deployed to the sea floor and left in place for about 1\\u2009h, which allowed bubble sampling and bubble image recording, followed by statistical treatment of records. Bubble sizes were calculated relative to the sizes of particular parts of the Niskin bottles, which were marked with measuring tape, and treated statistically to obtain observed frequencies (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).\\n\\n(e)\\n\\n\\nQuantification of methane fluxes from the seafloor\\n\\nTo quantify CH4 fluxes conveyed by bubbles releasing from the seafloor, we implemented an approach in which we aimed to combine the advantage of accuracy that could be achieved by evaluating CH4 flux using direct seep observations, with the advantage of wide area coverage, which was achieved by collecting bubble-imagery sonar data. To interpret sonar data, we performed an in situ calibration using a method described in detail in [23]. Calibration aimed to establish a relationship between the backscattering strength of CH4 bubbles and gas flux rate. Results achieved by use of in situ calibration were validated by comparing these results with estimates obtained based on direct in situ observations of CH4 bubble flow.\\n\\nImplementation of this approach included a few steps. First, we detected areas of seep fields within the studied area using single-beam sonar. Then, we classified these seep fields by area size and strength of the backscattering signal recorded by sonar. After that, we focused on detailed surveys of randomly chosen seep fields to evaluate the number of individual seeps in each seep field. Several such seeps, in which bubbles were distinctly emitted from the seafloor one by one, were chosen for continuing observation to obtain bubble sizes and rates of bubble release per unit of time. For each seep, mean CH4 flux was calculated by multiplying mean bubble volume (assuming 100% CH4 content) by mean bubble release rate observed during the time of observation. Finally, we assessed bubble-induced CH4 flux using the results of in situ sonar calibration of sonar data (electronic supplementary material, figure S3).\\n\\nFor calibration, we used nitrogen (N2) as a calibration gas (40\\u2009l volume, 460\\u2009atm). The tank was installed on the foredeck of our research vessel. PVC pipe, 12\\u2009mm in diameter, 6\\u2009mm wall thickness, 70\\u2009m long, was attached to Kevlar wire with a heavy metal load (about 30\\u2009kg) on the end and was deployed to a depth of 40\\u2009m where the water depth was 45\\u2009m. The multi-beam and single-beam sonars were located near each other so that their beam coverage overlapped, but the centre points of the beam diagrams focused on the bubble stream produced using a copper nozzle 4\\u2009mm in diameter attached to the end of the PVC pipe. Gas flux was tuned using a standard flow meter. One port of a flow meter was connected to a PVC pipe, the second port was connected to the gas tank through the gas reduction system, which consisted of one high-pressure sensor to measure the pressure remaining in the tank and one low-pressure sensor to measure the emitted pressure (5.5\\u2009atm). Gas flow changed from 0.5 to 150\\u2009l\\u2009min−1. Measurements started after the gas flow stabilized and lasted about 10\\u2009min for each session. We conducted eight sessions in the chosen location. No natural seepages occurred in this place and the sea floor was almost flat, excluding (or at least reducing) the possibility of scattering from the bottom. Wind during the sessions was 1–3\\u2009m\\u2009s−1 and there were almost no waves. Conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) data were obtained for the site using an SBE19plus CTD probe (USA). The vessel was anchored during the calibration session. In situ calibration of an operational system allowed the measured echo level of a known acoustically insonified bubble volume to be directly related to the bubble flux rate (electronic supplementary material, tables S1 and S2). The final step aimed to estimate the total number of seeps in the studied area by estimating seep density, which allowed interpolation of CH4 fluxes within the studied area.\\n\\n(f)\\n\\n\\nCalculation of seep field density\\n\\nSeep density is the spatial distribution of the seeps per square unit of the seep field area (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). To establish correlation between the backscatter value and the numbers of acoustically detected seeps/flares per m2, we used a method described in detail in [24]. Because we detected seeps using the single-beam echo sounder, to establish a correlation we considered the area that was actually insonified by the system. The size of the examined area was estimated as the total length of the vessel's path over the sections of the examined area multiplied by the width of the zone sounded by the echo sounder (the diameter of the circle bounded by the beam width of the echo sounder transducer). The total number of seep fields was determined by multiplying seep field density by the study area (more details could be found in the electronic supplementary material).\\n\\n(g)\\n\\n\\nSpatial distribution of organic carbon content (Corg)\\n\\n\\nCorg data were obtained from surface sediments sampled by Van Veen grab at more than 700 sites in the ESAS over the 2003–2009 period. The study areas visited in different years are presented in [25]. Concentrations of Corg in surface sediment were measured at the University of Alaska Fairbanks using a Finnigan isotope ratio mass spectrometer as described in detail in [26].\\n\\n(h)\\n\\n\\nMethane oxidation rates\\n\\nCH4 oxidation rates were measured in the water column, using a C3H4 radiotracer following the procedure described in [27]. The CH4 oxidation rate constant was calculated following [27] and multiplied by in situ CH4 concentration to determine the CH4 oxidation rate (more details could be found in the electronic supplementary material).(i)\\n\\n\\nSubsea permafrost modelling\\n\\nThe thermodynamic model of soil freezing/thawing, which already partially incorporated thermokarst and land–ocean interaction theory [14], was forced by seawater temperature dynamics in the ESAS and computed by GCMs. The permafrost was simulated using the 100-year mean benthic temperature; the local seawater warming effect from the Lena River discharge was incorporated using original data as described in [10]. To compute temperature dynamics at sites within tectonics fault zones, we used a 2D realization of the thermodynamic model, which allows simulation of open talik formation and evolution. The systematic variability associated with horsts and grabens was characterized by a 2D Fourier series. To compute temperature dynamics in time, a finite-element scheme, backward Euler in time, and based on the enthalpy technique for the solution of Stefan-type problems, was used.\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\n\\nModelling lateral transport of dissolved methane on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf\\n\\nThe climatological circulation in the AO during 1997–2006 was reconstructed by assimilating oceanic and surface heat data into the Semi-Implicit Ocean Model [28,29] with 26×26\\u2009km resolution using the 4D variational approach [30]. The reconstructed annual velocities at 12.5\\u2009m water depth were used to calculate the trajectories of several groups of Lagrangian particles (molecules of dissolved CH4) using the standard Runge–Kutta fourth-order-accuracy algorithm [31]. Transport of the particles was integrated for periods of 2 and 3 years, which is in accordance with turnover time of the dissolved CH4 pool in the ESAS (more details could be found in the electronic supplementary material).3.\\n\\n\\nResults(a)\\n\\n\\nResults of seep detection over the study area\\n\\nWe observed a high concentration of bubble seeps in P1, where we detected large seep fields of up to 700 individual seeps, including flares (figure 2). Not all seep fields were subjected to detailed observation by the deployed ROV, but we observed no seeps surrounded by bacterial mats. That might indicate that bubble flux is the predominant source of CH4 in the sites and the supply of dissolved CH4 is insufficient to support bacterial communities. We observed 112 flare seep fields located in the 50–90\\u2009m depth range. Statistical testing of the datasets, which included calculated areas of seep fields, allowed us to define three classes of seep fields: small seep field (SF), medium seep field (MF) and large seep field (LF) seep fields with mean areas of 85.2\\u2009m2, 2.2×104\\u2009m2 and 4.2×104\\u2009m2, respectively (electronic supplementary material, table S1).\\n\\n\\nFigure 2. Hydro-acoustical images of detected seep fields including flares observed in P1 (September–October 2011). (a) Medium seep fields including flares (MF); (b) Large seep fields associated with large flares (LF). (c) Small seep field associated with small flares (SF).(b)\\n\\n\\nMethane flux by direct bubble observation\\n\\nBased on video recording, we estimated the amount of CH4 released by bubbles escaping from the seafloor at different seep sites. To assess bubble sizes, we analysed more than 1000 records of bubbles, the radii of which varied from 1 to 10\\u2009mm with the greater fraction (more than 70%) being in the range of 3–6\\u2009mm with mean radius of 4\\u2009mm (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). During the observed period, bubble release from single vents varied from 1.5 to 5.7\\u2009bubbles\\u2009s−1; for approximately 50% of the time fluxes remained steady, but then they ceased or increased; in a few seeps, fluxes stopped for approximately 30% of the observed time but then started up again. For our estimates, we assumed steady flux maintained approximately 50% of the time by 3.6\\u2009bubbles\\u2009s−1 of 4\\u2009mm in radius, giving a mean flux of 0.044\\u2009mmol-CH4\\u2009s−1, corresponding to 3.4\\u2009mol-CH4\\u2009d−1 or 54.4\\u2009g\\u2009d−1 from one vent. This implies that areal flux would vary depending on the number of vents within the seepage area, which might change from tens to hundreds in one seep field.\\n\\n(c)\\n\\n\\nMethane fluxes by absolute calibration\\n\\nTo approach area-weighted fluxes, we estimated the density of the seep fields in the study area. First, we established a relationship between seep field occurrence along the ship's path and the area covered by a sonar beam in a single survey. To minimize uncertainty while establishing a correlation between backscatter value and seep occurrence, we performed in-depth investigation of a few seep fields in order to achieve the densest area coverage possible in particular field conditions (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). For example, in the 5.76\\u2009km2 F5 seep field, 2.3\\u2009km2 was actually insonified, which represents 40% of the total seep field area; in the 9.8\\u2009km2 F93 seep field, we achieved 13% coverage of the entire seep field area. The size of the examined area was estimated by multiplying the total length of the vessel's path over the sections of the examined area by the width of the zone sounded by sonar. Density was then estimated by dividing the size of the examined area by the number of observed seep fields of a certain size. We calculated mean CH4 fluxes from SF, MF and LF seep fields to be 30.8, 88 and 176\\u2009g CH4\\u2009m−2\\u2009d−1, respectively. Using estimated density, integrated minimum CH4 flux to the water column in the P1 was estimated to be 1.94×1010\\u2009g CH4\\u2009d−1 (electronic supplementary material, table S2).\\n\\nThese results suggest that estimates based on calibration curves are more conservative than those performed based on direct observations of bubbles, because the radii of the observed bubbles were larger than were those used in calibration. Another reason could be that when bubbles are released as large streams, they might interact with each other creating acoustical coupling; this could potentially decrease the sonar return signal (backscatter) [32]. A number of uncertainties exist in the quantitative assessment of bubble-transported CH4 fluxes, because the gas exchange between bubbles and water depends on bubble size, shape, bubble rise velocity as well as on varying properties of seawater [33]. One such uncertainty springs from the fact that the ability of single-beam sonar to capture seeps outside the area covered by the beam is limited. To minimize this uncertainty, coverage of 13–40% was achieved during in-depth studies of chosen seep fields (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Another uncertainty is related to the sporadic nature of seeps and flares, which causes high temporal variability of CH4 fluxes [23,24]. When acoustic targets are highly concentrated (like bubbles in plumes), a shadowing effect might occur [22]. To eliminate or minimize the shadowing effect, some authors [32,33] have suggested using frequencies higher than 50\\u2009kHz and calibrating the sonar system using gas emitted at known flux rates that was implemented in our study.\\n\\nIn October 2013, we performed observations in the southernmost part of P2 (figure 1), in Ivashkina Lagoon, which has been progressively inundated during the last approximately 100–200 years, replacing a former thermokarst lake (figure 3). The importance of this investigation is in that according to an existing assumption (which is one of the most important in permafrost modelling), submerged thermokarst lakes, which widely developed over the ESAS in the beginning of the Holocene, become frozen after submergence; therefore, no gas release should have occurred from that lagoon [14,17]. Despite that assumption, we observed vigorous bubble release from narrow and steep depressions aligned parallel to the lagoon's northern edge. Backscattering cross-sections of the bubbles emitted from 17 seeps observed in the Ivashkina Lagoon were recorded for 36\\u2009h using portable single-beam sonar, which was calibrated in situ during the same campaign. In the Ivashkina Lagoon, CH4 fluxes observed in October 2013 ranged from 5 to 24\\u2009g\\u2009m−2\\u2009d−1 (averaged over the total area of 3000\\u2009m2). Our observations demonstrate that understanding of the process of permafrost degradation and associated permeability of permafrost for gases after submergence needs to be improved.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3. Results of CH4 flux observations in the Ivashkina Lagoon (October 2013). (a) The former thermokarst lake (mean depth less than 2\\u2009m) is transforming into a sea lagoon; (b) bubble releases in the lagoon occur from the steep narrow depressions observed in the north part of the lagoon; (c) CH4 releases occur from shallow depths and reach the atmosphere. Estimated rates of these releases are from 5.5 to 24\\u2009g\\u2009m−2\\u2009d−1.(d)\\n\\n\\nFraction of methane reaching the sea surface\\n\\nTo assess what fraction of CH4 bubbles reaches the sea surface, we performed experimental work from the fast ice in April 2013 in the southern part of P2. We drilled a hole in the sea ice and created an artificial seep at approximately 6\\u2009m water depth as described above. A gas tank was installed on the fast ice. By tuning the valve (changing the pressure) installed on the gas tank head, bubble flow controlled by a flowmeter was changed from 0.2 to 2.0\\u2009l\\u2009min−1 by creating a flow of approximately 5\\u2009mm diameter bubbles. We captured these bubbles escaping from the water surface using a chamber installed over the hole in the sea ice. After 1\\u2009h of exposure, we examined the composition of gas collected in the chamber and measured actual CH4 flux from the water surface. Our data show that at a shallow water depth, approximately 67–72% of CH4 remains in the bubbles when the bubbles reach the sea surface (electronic supplementary material, table S3). This assessment is only applicable to shallow water depths; to assess the fraction of CH4 that reaches the surface from deeper water, there is a need to perform additional investigations of bubble plume dynamics in the water column.\\n\\n(e)\\n\\n\\nFate of methane released to the water column\\n\\nHow much of the CH4 carried by bubbles will reach the sea surface and be released to the atmosphere largely depends on the CH4 flux rate, water depth and in situ release conditions that control transfer processes [32,33]. Most of the CH4 dissolves in the water column, building up an aqueous CH4 inventory. The fate of dissolved CH4 largely depends on the interaction between a few factors: the turnover time of dissolved CH4 in the water column, the stability of the water column against vertical mixing and the rates of turbulent diffusion and lateral advection. Dissolved CH4 in the outer ESAS requires 300–1000 days to be oxidized in the water column because CH4 oxidation rates are very low (mean±1\\u2009s.d.: 0.0988±0.1343\\u2009nM\\u2009d−1, p=0.95, n=328). During this time, some of the aqueous CH4 inventory is likely to be released to the atmosphere during storms [10]. The remaining dissolved CH4, captured beneath the sea ice in winter, can spread further from the ESAS via currents (figure 4), and some can escape to the atmosphere through leads and breaks in the ice [34].\\n\\n\\nFigure 4.

Current velocities are shown as blue arrows; CH4 trajectories in the first year are shown as red arrows, in the second year as green arrows, and in the third year as black arrows.4.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion and conclusion(a)\\n\\n\\nRole of the sea ice\\n\\nSea ice serves as a natural physical barrier that restricts CH4 emissions from the ESAS during the ice-covered period. Because the temperature in the Arctic has increased at twice the rate as in the rest of the globe, and the region is expected to increase an additional 8°C (14°F) in the twenty-first century [3], longer periods of open water and shorter ice-covered periods [35,36] are occurring. Increasing periods of open water implies an increasing number of storm events, when wind speed increases to 15\\u2009m\\u2009s−1 or more and the boundary between sea surface and air increases many times due to deep water mixing. Such events have the potential to rapidly ventilate bubble-transported and dissolved CH4 from the water column, producing high emission rates to the atmosphere. Because more than 75% of the total ESAS area is less than 50\\u2009m in depth, the water column provides bubbles with a very short conduit to the atmosphere. Storms enable more CH4 release because they destroy shallow water stratification and increase the boundary between sea surface and air, thus increasing gas exchange across phase boundaries. As a result, bubble-mediated, storm-induced CH4 ‘pulses’ force a greater fraction of CH4 to bypass aqueous microbial filters and reach the atmosphere [10].\\n\\nIn addition, about 10% of the ESAS remains open water in winter due to formation of flaw polynyas. It was shown that flaw polynyas provide pathways for CH4 escape to the atmosphere during the arctic winter [37]. Areas of flaw polynyas in the ESAS increased dramatically (by up to five times) during the last decades, and now exceed the total area of the Siberian wetlands (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). This implies that the ESAS remains an active source of CH4 to the atmosphere year-round. Increasing storminess [38–40] and rapid sea-ice retreat [36] causing increased CH4 fluxes from the ESAS are possible new climate-change-driven processes. Continuing warming of the AO will strengthen these processes, and the role of the ESAS as a year-round contributor to global CH4 emissions will grow over time.\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n\\nImplications for future emissions\\n\\nThese new data together with those obtained previously show very high variability of CH4 fluxes in the ESAS. On the one hand, this points to a lack of established methods that can be used for quantitative assessment of fluxes, both diffusive and bubble-transported. Indeed, because the major driving parameter in calculations of diffusive fluxes is wind speed, adjustment of climatic winds to actual winds changed the estimated CH4 fluxes by two orders of magnitude [41,42]. Quantitative derivation of bubble fluxes remains difficult because seep fields could include flares and a number of factors affect the seabed, water column and sea–air fluxes [24,32,33]. In the ESAS, the water column is very shallow and provides a very short path for bubble-transported CH4 to the atmosphere. Because the ESAS is the largest shelf in the World Ocean, the development of methods applicable for estimating bubbling flux from large areas over a relatively short time (the period of open water in the Arctic) is very important. Among the methods used to date, the hydro-acoustical method described in [23] and modified in this study seems to be most suitable for flux estimates over large areas rather than for localized in situ observations, which could be more area-specific. In situ calibration of an operational system allows the measured echo level of a known acoustically insonified bubble volume to be directly related to the bubble flux rate, reducing the number of system parameters that must be known.\\n\\nOn the other hand, these data support the hypothesis that variability of CH4 fluxes is determined by the current state of subsea permafrost, which is undergoing destabilization caused by the long-lasting warming effect of inundation by seawater that started at the beginning of the Holocene. Indeed, in the ESAS, organic carbon (Corg) contents of sediments vary by only a factor of approximately 4, while CH4 fluxes vary by orders of magnitude (figure 5). Such flux variability could be determined by many factors, including the deep geological structures; however, test results showed that when ice saturation is more than 80%, CH4 gas can be completely sealed within the permafrost [43]. This means that when subsea permafrost is ice-bonded and continuous, it is virtually impermeable for mass transfer from geological sources beneath the permafrost [44,45]. Therefore, the state of subsea permafrost is becoming a key factor controlling CH4 fluxes from the seabed to the water column in the ESAS.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5. Distribution of total Corg in the surface sediments versus current state of subsea permafrost and methane (CH4) fluxes from the sea floor/sea surface in the ESAS. As seen from panel (a), the percentage of Corg in the surface sediments varies by a factor of 4 (from less than 0.5% to more than 2%) over the ESAS; Corg content distribution is based on analysis of samples from more than 700 sites visited in the ESAS during 2003–2009. Polygon 1 (P1) is representative of ESAS areas where the Corg percentage varies from low to moderate levels (less than 0.5–1.5%); polygon 2 (P2) is representative of ESAS areas where the highest Corg percentage (more than 1.5%) is observed. P1 and P2 are marked with black rectangles. (b) Rates of CH4 fluxes observed in the ESAS versus results of permafrost modelling. Areas marked in coral represent areas where subsea permafrost is predicted to be exhibiting the most advanced stages of degradation due to duration of inundation; CH4 fluxes to the bottom water vary from 30 to 170\\u2009g\\u2009m2\\u2009d−1. Areas marked in yellow represent areas of modelled taliks developing due to geological factors (faults) and warming effect of river discharge; estimated fluxes to the bottom water in these areas vary from 5 to 24\\u2009g\\u2009m2\\u2009d−1; fluxes to the atmosphere in one such area was estimated from 100 to 630\\u2009mg\\u2009m2\\u2009d−1 [10]. Areas marked in blue represent the areas where subsea permafrost presumably remains the least disintegrated; CH4 fluxes from these areas vary from 3\\u2009mg\\u2009m2\\u2009d−1 (in background areas) to 30\\u2009mg\\u2009m2\\u2009d−1 (in the hot spots) [9]. Green colour shows the land; orange lines mark the coastline.\\n\\nThe range of modern CH4 emissions from the seafloor in the ESAS serves as a baseline for monitoring future dynamics in CH4 fluxes from the ESAS. We suggest that within the entire range of observed fluxes, the lowest fluxes are associated with an initial degree of subsea permafrost thawing observed in the shallow shelf outside the areas affected by faults, rivers and pre-existing thermokarst. These fluxes are fuelled by modern methanogenesis occurring within sediment accumulations of the Holocene age, which have never been frozen, and/or within partially thawed older sediments beneath them. The highest rates observed over the outer shelf area are likely to represent the maximum emissions, which combine recently produced CH4 and long-accumulated pre-formed CH4 escaping from seabed deposits through gas migration pathways that are growing in capacity. Shallow hot spots, currently releasing CH4 at high rates, are representative of local subsea permafrost disintegration that takes place in areas subjected to development of deep/open taliks due to increased fault-related geothermal flux and/or river heat-induced flux and/or thermokarst progression after submergence.\\n\\nThe observed range in CH4 emissions associated with different degrees of subsea permafrost disintegration implies substantial and potent emission enhancement in the ESAS as the process of subsea permafrost thawing progresses with time. While it is still unclear how quickly CH4 flux rates will change, the current process of Arctic warming and associated sea ice loss [35,36] will accelerate this process. The potential for the release of substantial amounts of CH4 from the ESAS region has important implications not only for atmospheric CH4 concentrations but also, given CH4's potency as a greenhouse gas, for the global climate. Because the ESAS contains the largest and arguably most vulnerable stores of subsea CH4 [2,10,46,47], inclusion of the ESAS source in global climate models should be considered a high priority.\\n\\n\\nSupplementary Material\\n\\n\\nSupplementary Material includes Supplementary methods, Tables (S1-S3), Supplementary Figures (S1-S6) and Supplementary References (S1-S11)\", 'text_matches': ['field area', 'study area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'The East Siberian Arctic Shelf: towards further assessment of permafrost-related methane fluxes and role of sea ice', 'journal_title': 'Philosophical transactions.

In Pakistan, community workers called Lady Health Workers (LHW) deliver basic health care at the doorstep in the rural areas and urban slums.

In addition, communication skills learning should be an essential part of their training programme.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Health workers deployed from within their own communities to deliver basic health care have various titles but \"Community Health Worker (CHW)\" is the term most commonly used to describe this cadre. According to the WHO: \"Community Health Workers should be members of the communities where they work, should be selected by the communities, should be answerable to the communities for their activities, should be supported by the health system but not necessarily a part of its organization, and have shorter training than professional workers.\" These workers play a crucial role in improving access and broadening coverage of health services in far flung areas and can contribute to improved health outcomes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].</p><p>The \"Lady Health Worker\" (LHW) of the National Programme for Family Planning and Primary Health Care in Pakistan broadly fits into the definition of community health worker, and is a crucial component of the health care delivery system of the country. The Lady Health Workers Programme (LHWP) is a federally funded development programme working at the grass root level since 1994. About 96,000 workers and their supervisors have been trained and deployed in all the 135 districts of Pakistan. They currently cover about 65% of the target population (rural and urban slums), and full coverage is planned in the next few years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. Pakistan has high maternal and infant mortality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], low women\\'s access to health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>] with less than one third going to health centres unescorted [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>], and low contraceptive usage among the rural population [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. Thus the job of the LHW is challenging.</p><p>The job description of the LHW has evolved over time. Initially it included health education and basic preventive services for family planning; maternal and child health; improving nutrition; basic hygiene and sanitation; and child immunization. Today it also includes mass immunization for polio eradication; newborn care; maternal immunization with tetanus toxoid (TT); referral of eligible cases to health facilities and regular record-keeping for updating the management information system (MIS) of the programme; community management of tuberculosis; and health education on HIV-AIDS and Hepatitis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. Lady Health Workers are seldom consulted when their job description changes. This ever-enlarging scope of work of the LHW in which they have little say can result in occupational stress. This condition defined as \"any physical or psychological event perceived as potentially constituting physical harm or emotional distress\", if present in health workers can have an adverse impact on their efficiency [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>].</p><p>Since the commencement of LHWP in Pakistan, a number of programme evaluations have been carried out. Most extensive among these was the national-level, external evaluation conducted during 2000&#x02013;2001 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>]. It concluded that the programme succeeded in creating a large sized organization comprising female community health workers and establishing a functional programme management and supply system. It found evidence that the programme improved the uptake of important health services in areas covered by its LHW. At the same time it recommended that the quality of work needed improvement. But there was no information on the LHWs\\' own views about their job description and levels of occupational stress. These factors would be important in the improvement in the quality of service delivery and under performance/utilization of existing LHWs. The domain in general is poorly researched and systematic reviews have pointed out knowledge gaps in areas like job satisfaction/dissatisfaction and job retention/attrition [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>].</p><p>We assessed the perceived level of job stress, personal efficiency and quality of service delivery by LHW. An attempt was made to understand factors which might be responsible for below optimal performance of LHWs.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"methods\"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Area</title><p>The study was conducted in Tehsil Kahuta, one of the six Tehsils (sub-districts) of District Rawalpindi, located 60 Km southeast of the capital city of Islamabad.

The Tehsil is a typical rural area of Pakistan, and is similar to most of the under-developed rural areas in South Asia. The average household consists of 6.2 members. Most families depend on subsistence farming, supplemented by earnings of one or more of the adult male members serving in the public sector, the armed forces or the private sector. Male and female literacy rates are 80% and 50% respectively. The infant mortality rate is 84 per 1000 live births. There are 20 basic health units and two rural health centres, employing 28 doctors, 12 midwives, 15 vaccinators, and about 200 LHWs, providing basic primary health care.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and Study design</title><p>Multi-stage, stratified, random sampling was done. 15 out of 20 union councils of the sub-district Kahuta were randomly selected.

It has clearly shown that over a quarter (26%) of the LHWs of the National Programme are mentally distressed. In addition to the administrative issues like inadequate amount and irregular disbursement of salary, and inadequate and irregular supply of medicine and other supplies, the rest of the \\'causes for concern\\' are related to communication and interpersonal skills. The study has also established that a large proportion of health workers of this important public health program are not satisfied with their job because of the perceived absence of professional development and lack of career path.</p><p>A motivated workforce has been described as central to any health system. The improvement of human resource management in the health sector has been recommended in order to achieve millennium development goals (MDGs) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. The third party evaluation of LHW Programme [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>] also mentioned the need to improve quality of the work through improved management of the workforce. To achieve this, LHW\\'s own opinion about the factors contributing to their job satisfaction/dissatisfaction must be studied. The qualitative nature of our study has enabled us to gain some insights in this area. At the same time, this qualitative study conducted in one sub-district has obvious limitations and is only suggestive at best.</p><p>The potential role of CHWs in improving community health has been acknowledged especially in resource poor countries. Haines et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>] have described that owing to the inverse relationship of density of health workers (doctors, nurses, midwives) with maternal, infant and under 5 mortality; coupled with high cost of training doctors and nurses and the low use of services based in health facilities in many areas, there is a possibility to make substantial health gains from the use of community health workers. The Task Force for Scaling up Education and Training for Health Workers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] recommended improving education of these workers through quality assurance programs and urged international action to scale up the production of quality health workers.</p><p>Other studies have also reported areas for improvement in the structure and performance of CHW programs including the LHWP of Pakistan. The low salary and lack of career path was highlighted by Afsar et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] as a reason for job dissatisfaction among the LHWs. Mumtaz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] reported abusive hierarchical management structure, disrespect from male colleagues, lack of sensitivity to women\\'s gender-based cultural constraints, conflict between domestic and work responsibility and poor infrastructural support as the important problems faced by female primary health care workers from their study conducted in 1998 when the program was only four years old. Our study suggests that the disrespect from male colleagues and conflict between domestic and work related responsibility has improved while the other factors remain the same.</p><p>Douthwaite &#x00026; Ward [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] found that the LHWP succeeded in increasing the use of modern contraceptives by rural women. According to them women served by LHW were significantly more likely to use a modern reversible methods than women in communities not served by LHW after controlling for various individual and household characteristics. They advocated for continuation of providing doorstep services through community-based workers to achieve universal access to safe family planning methods. Our study suggests that communication on family planning is still perceived as a difficult area by these workers and, while the programme should be continued, some interpersonal communication (IPC) capacity building measures are needed to further improve performance and outcomes.</p><p>Multifaceted interventions (e.g. training plus supervision) which address multiple determinants of performance have been recommended [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>] to improve CHW performance. We add that improvement in remuneration; clear career path and improved administration are also required. In addition, empowering communication techniques should be built into the training and on-going supervision processes to improve the effectiveness of the community health workers.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors\\' contributions</title><p>ZH carried out analysis of data, conceptualized this paper and drafted the manuscript while ZI and AR helped in the design and supervision of the study and reviewed drafts.

communities to deliver basic health care have various titles but \"Community Health Worker (CHW)\" is the term most commonly used to describe this cadre. According to the WHO: \"Community Health Workers should be members of the communities where they work, should be selected by the communities, should be answerable to the communities for their activities, should be supported by the health system but not necessarily a part of its organization, and have shorter training than professional workers.\" These workers play a crucial role in improving access and broadening coverage of health services in far flung areas and can contribute to improved health outcomes [1].\\n\\nThe \"Lady Health Worker\" (LHW) of the National Programme for Family Planning and Primary Health Care in Pakistan broadly fits into the definition of community health worker, and is a crucial component of the health care delivery system of the country. The Lady Health Workers Programme (LHWP) is a federally funded development programme working at the grass root level since 1994. About 96,000 workers and their supervisors have been trained and deployed in all the 135 districts of Pakistan. They currently cover about 65% of the target population (rural and urban slums), and full coverage is planned in the next few years [2]. Pakistan has high maternal and infant mortality [3], low women\\'s access to health services [4,5] with less than one third going to health centres unescorted [6], and low contraceptive usage among the rural population [7,8]. Thus the job of the LHW is challenging.\\n\\nThe job description of the LHW has evolved over time. Initially it included health education and basic preventive services for family planning; maternal and child health; improving nutrition; basic hygiene and sanitation; and child immunization. Today it also includes mass immunization for polio eradication; newborn care; maternal immunization with tetanus toxoid (TT); referral of eligible cases to health facilities and regular record-keeping for updating the management information system (MIS) of the programme; community management of tuberculosis; and health education on HIV-AIDS and Hepatitis [2]. Lady Health Workers are seldom consulted when their job description changes. This ever-enlarging scope of work of the LHW in which they have little say can result in occupational stress. This condition defined as \"any physical or psychological event perceived as potentially constituting physical harm or emotional distress\", if present in health workers can have an adverse impact on their efficiency [9-11].\\n\\nSince the commencement of LHWP in Pakistan, a number of programme evaluations have been carried out. Most extensive among these was the national-level, external evaluation conducted during 2000–2001 [12]. It concluded that the programme succeeded in creating a large sized organization comprising female community health workers and establishing a functional programme management and supply system. It found evidence that the programme improved the uptake of important health services in areas covered by its LHW. At the same time it recommended that the quality of work needed improvement. But there was no information on the LHWs\\' own views about their job description and levels of occupational stress. These factors would be important in the improvement in the quality of service delivery and under performance/utilization of existing LHWs. The domain in general is poorly researched and systematic reviews have pointed out knowledge gaps in areas like job satisfaction/dissatisfaction and job retention/attrition [13,14].\\n\\nWe assessed the perceived level of job stress, personal efficiency and quality of service delivery by LHW. An attempt was made to understand factors which might be responsible for below optimal performance of LHWs.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\n\\nStudy Area\\n\\nThe study was conducted in Tehsil Kahuta, one of the six Tehsils (sub-districts) of District Rawalpindi, located 60 Km southeast of the capital city of Islamabad. Kahuta has an area of 1096 Sq. Kms, a population of 313,200, and consists of 20 union councils (smallest administrative unit, each consisting of 5–12 villages). The Tehsil is a typical rural area of Pakistan, and is similar to most of the under-developed rural areas in South Asia. The average household consists of 6.2 members. Most families depend on subsistence farming, supplemented by earnings of one or more of the adult male members serving in the public sector, the armed forces or the private sector. Male and female literacy rates are 80% and 50% respectively. The infant mortality rate is 84 per 1000 live births. There are 20 basic health units and two rural health centres, employing 28 doctors, 12 midwives, 15 vaccinators, and about 200 LHWs, providing basic primary health care.\\n\\n\\nSubjects and Study design\\n\\nMulti-stage, stratified, random sampling was done. 15 out of 20 union councils of the sub-district Kahuta were randomly selected. Union councils not covered by LHW were excluded. The sample comprised all LHWs from the selected union councils who were physically healthy (without any diagnosed or known chronic illness), aged 18–50 years, based at their respective villages, married or un-married, had education of grade 8 and above, willing to participate in the study and having at least one year of work experience as LHW.\\n\\nThe study design was cross sectional. It consisted of three sub-components (i) survey type investigation aimed at describing accurately the characteristics of the LHW specific beliefs, attitude and opinion related variables including socio-demographic profile (ii) comparison of naturally occurring variables of work-related stress (iii) qualitative analysis of LHWs work-related problems and their suggestions to improve their role as primary agent for primary health care. The study used three techniques for the process of data collection including questionnaire, interview and focus group discussion.\\n\\n\\nInstruments\\n\\nTwo experienced Research Assistants (RAs) interviewed the LHWs individually at their homes. To collect data for the development of \\'socio-demographic profile of the LHW\\' a form was designed by adopting multiple methods including key informant interviews, and consultations with professional researchers/experts in the field. It was pre-tested and finalized before the actual data collection process. \\'Assessment of mental distress and work-related stress\\' was done by using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire, briefly known as SRQ-20 [15]. The SRQ has been translated, adapted and validated as a culturally sensitive and effective instrument in Pakistan [11,16].\\n\\nFurther, to supplement the SRQ-20, two additional scales, namely sources of \\'job pressure\\' and \\'job satisfaction\\' were used. The questionnaire was provided and the LHW was asked to mark her responses on a scale of 1 to 5 with reference to her sources of job pressure and job satisfaction. These two scales were translated, culturally adapted and pre-tested using a standard procedure [17]. Originally, Occupational Stress Indicators (OSInd) was developed by Cooper et al [18].\\n\\nTo document \\'Perceived job description & identification of LHWs problems\\' a form containing two open-ended questions was used. The responses to these questions were recorded on a proforma for further content analysis. In order to conduct a Qualitative analysis of LHWs problems & suggestions focus group discussions (FGDs) were organized within the field area. A sub-sample of LHWs participated in the FGDs.\\n\\n\\nData collection and analysis\\n\\nA total of 150 LHWs were randomly selected according to inclusion criteria and asked to fill out the questionnaires. Interviews were also conducted with all these LHWs. Six Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were organized using a sub-sample (48/150) of these LHWs. The RAs obtained lists of all working LHWs in the selected union councils from the concerned authorities. The RAs collected data from the LHWs after getting their informed consent. All the data including socio-demographic variables, SRQ, LHWs perceptions about their job description and problems, and sources of job pressure and job satisfaction scales was collected in a single visit.\\n\\nSix focus groups were organized with subgroups of LHWs for the assessment of their work-related problems and practical suggestions to improve their job related efficiency/quality. The collected data were coded and entered in a computerized database by an expert data controller/statistician. A trained statistician performed the data analysis and generated outputs under the supervision of the principal investigator.\\n\\nThe quantitative data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 10.0), applying \\'inferential\\' t-test and descriptive statistical methods as appropriate. Inductive content analysis method was used to analyze the qualitative data of the focus group discussions to generate relevant result categories.\\n\\nThe study was completed between15 April 2003 and 31 January 2004. Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Development Research Foundation (HDRF), Pakistan.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\nAll 150 interviews were successfully completed. Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. Table 2 presents a summary of SRQ, SPJ and OSI scores. In SRQ, a cut-off score of 8 or more was taken to indicate the presence of mental distress. Based on this cut-off, 26% of respondents had mental distress. Taking a score of 40–50 (1 sd) on the SPJ as a cut off revealed that 14% of the respondent LHWs were experiencing high job pressure, while taking > 51 (2 sd) as the cut-off point showed that an additional 5% had a very high job pressure, resulting in a cumulative figure of 19% of respondents having significant job pressure.\\n\\nTable 1\\nDemographic Variable\\tMean\\tStandard Deviation\\tRange\\n1.

Three variables had a statistically significant effect on the LHW resulting in job stress. These included having to travel 2 km or more every day to perform her job, living a distance of 3 km or more away from the BHU, and having a family income of PKR 4,000 per month or less. Age, marital status, number of children, and living in joint or nuclear family had no impact on the psychological state and did not appear to be a factor for increased job pressure.\\n\\nFactors leading to increased job pressure were also explored. Overall, the absence of career advancement was a source of moderate to very high pressure in 53% of the respondents (Table 3) while working with opposite sex was causing moderate to very high pressure in 23% of respondents. Being undervalued by the department was having a similar effect on 23% of the respondent LHWs while 29% of them felt moderate to high pressure because of the things not under their direct control.\\n\\nTable 3\\nNo\\tCategories\\tVery Little\\tLittle\\tModerate\\tMuch\\tMost\\n1\\tAbsence of potential career advancement\\t52 (34%)\\t19 (12%)\\t24 (16%)\\t25 (17%)\\t30 (20%)\\n2\\tWorking with the opposite sex\\t84 (56%)\\t31 (20%)\\t12 (8%)\\t8 (5%)\\t15 (10%)\\n3\\tFactors not under direct control\\t78 (52%)\\t26 (17%)\\t22 (14%)\\t14 (9%)\\t10 (6%)\\n4\\tBeing undervalued by the department\\t81 (54%)\\t32 (21%)\\t16 (10%)\\t14 (9%)\\t7 (4%)\\n\\nOccupational Stress Indicator (OSI) was used as a measure of job satisfaction among the respondents and the mean OSI for the group was 33.96 (Table 2). On a scale of 1–5, the level of job satisfaction and factors responsible were also explored. Overall, 56% of the respondents expressed very little to moderate job satisfaction. 79% reported very little to moderate satisfaction with amount of salary, 39% of the respondents reported low satisfaction with the professional skills they had while 65% had a low level of inspiration in terms of professional development (Table 4).\\n\\nTable 4\\nNo\\tCategories\\tVery Little\\tLittle\\tModerate\\tMuch\\tMost\\n1\\tLevel of job satisfaction\\t15 (10%)\\t12 (8%)\\t58 (38%)\\t31 (20%)\\t34 (22%)\\n2\\tSatisfaction with the amount of work\\t20 (13%)\\t16 (10%)\\t32 (21%)\\t43 (28%)\\t39 (26%)\\n3\\tSatisfaction with amount of salary\\t65 (43%)\\t26 (17%)\\t29 (19%)\\t14 (9%)\\t16 (10%)\\n4\\tSatisfaction with professional skills\\t10 (6%)\\t5 (3%)\\t45 (30%)\\t35 (23%)\\t55 (36%)\\n\\nThe researchers also asked an open-ended question about the main problem the LHW faced while performing her job. Problems that were reported with high frequency (20% or more) have been shown in Figure 1. The most common problem reported was dealing with administrative inefficiency such as irregular supply of medicines and vaccines (70%) and not getting their salary on time. Inadequate salary was the next biggest problems reported by over 60% of the respondents. Other problems included difficulty motivating mothers and families to get their children immunized and take preventive measures, difficulty in communicating on family planning issues, non cooperative attitudes of community and inadequate information, education, communication (IEC) materials and other job aids.\\n\\nFigure 1 Most common problems reported by the LHWs.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study from Pakistan that focused on the LHW\\'s work related stress and various factors contributing to it. It has clearly shown that over a quarter (26%) of the LHWs of the National Programme are mentally distressed. In addition to the administrative issues like inadequate amount and irregular disbursement of salary, and inadequate and irregular supply of medicine and other supplies, the rest of the \\'causes for concern\\' are related to communication and interpersonal skills. The study has also established that a large proportion of health workers of this important public health program are not satisfied with their job because of the perceived absence of professional development and lack of career path.\\n\\nA motivated workforce has been described as central to any health system. The improvement of human resource management in the health sector has been recommended in order to achieve millennium development goals (MDGs) [19]. The third party evaluation of LHW Programme [12] also mentioned the need to improve quality of the work through improved management of the workforce. To achieve this, LHW\\'s own opinion about the factors contributing to their job satisfaction/dissatisfaction must be studied. The qualitative nature of our study has enabled us to gain some insights in this area. At the same time, this qualitative study conducted in one sub-district has obvious limitations and is only suggestive at best.\\n\\nThe potential role of CHWs in improving community health has been acknowledged especially in resource poor countries. Haines et al [14] have described that owing to the inverse relationship of density of health workers (doctors, nurses, midwives) with maternal, infant and under 5 mortality; coupled with high cost of training doctors and nurses and the low use of services based in health facilities in many areas, there is a possibility to make substantial health gains from the use of community health workers. The Task Force for Scaling up Education and Training for Health Workers [20] recommended improving education of these workers through quality assurance programs and urged international action to scale up the production of quality health workers.\\n\\nOther studies have also reported areas for improvement in the structure and performance of CHW programs including the LHWP of Pakistan. The low salary and lack of career path was highlighted by Afsar et al [21] as a reason for job dissatisfaction among the LHWs. Mumtaz et al. [22] reported abusive hierarchical management structure, disrespect from male colleagues, lack of sensitivity to women\\'s gender-based cultural constraints, conflict between domestic and work responsibility and poor infrastructural support as the important problems faced by female primary health care workers from their study conducted in 1998 when the program was only four years old. Our study suggests that the disrespect from male colleagues and conflict between domestic and work related responsibility has improved while the other factors remain the same.\\n\\nDouthwaite & Ward [23] found that the LHWP succeeded in increasing the use of modern contraceptives by rural women. According to them women served by LHW were significantly more likely to use a modern reversible methods than women in communities not served by LHW after controlling for various individual and household characteristics. They advocated for continuation of providing doorstep services through community-based workers to achieve universal access to safe family planning methods. Our study suggests that communication on family planning is still perceived as a difficult area by these workers and, while the programme should be continued, some interpersonal communication (IPC) capacity building measures are needed to further improve performance and outcomes.\\n\\nMultifaceted interventions (e.g. training plus supervision) which address multiple determinants of performance have been recommended [13] to improve CHW performance. We add that improvement in remuneration; clear career path and improved administration are also required. In addition, empowering communication techniques should be built into the training and on-going supervision processes to improve the effectiveness of the community health workers.\\n\\n\\nCompeting interests\\n\\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\\n\\n\\nAuthors\\' contributions\\n\\nZH carried out analysis of data, conceptualized this paper and drafted the manuscript while ZI and AR helped in the design and supervision of the study and reviewed drafts.

Some genetic changes may alter rod cells to be more susceptible to oxidative damage in the retina, which is exposed directly to the effects of light, leading to progressive retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>). In other genetic mutations, rod cells may die from other primary processes; and then when the rod cells die, the oxygen content in the retina rises, causing oxidative stress and secondary degeneration of the remaining cone cells. The retina is highly metabolically active, and is therefore prone to oxidative damage. Various anti-oxidants have been considered as possible candidates that might delay this progression. There have been numerous reports on the effects of antioxidants in delaying the degeneration of photoreceptors in animal models of RP (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>). Anti-oxidant supplementation has been found to be effective in the intervention of atrophic age-related macular degeneration (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>). Human clinical trials for antioxidants such as vitamins A and E, lutein, and docosahexaenoic acid have been conducted for RP with some beneficial effects noted (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>). Additionally, continuous modifications of anti-oxidant dosages and regimens have been tried as possible candidates for nutritional supplementation in RP. Recently, patients consuming a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and receiving 15,000 IU vitamin A daily were found to have a slower progression in decline of visual acuity over 4 to 6 yr (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>), raising hope for a possible delay of progression in RP patients.</p><p>Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenol found in various agricultural products such as coffee, beans, potatoes, and apples, and is formed by the esterification of caffeic and quinic acids. The antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-carcinogenic activities of CGA have been demonstrated in many studies (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>). CGA showed an anti-oxidant effect in vitro (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>), in cultured human endothelial cells (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>), and in rat models of ischemia/reperfusion injury to the liver (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>). The beneficial effect of CGA in coffee has been suggested in a human study monitoring the oxidation of proteins, DNA membrane lipids, and other redox biomarkers (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>). Several studies have also demonstrated its neuroprotective effect (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>).</p><p>Multifocal electroretinography (mERG) has recently been evaluated as an objective electrophysiological method to evaluate changes in retinal function in RP patients (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>). The response amplitude has been found to follow a similar exponential decay as the visual field and may provide reproducible responses, even if standard electroretinography (ERG) is nearly extinguished.</p><p>In order to evaluate the effect of CGA supplementation in patients with RP, we utilized mERG to objectively evaluate changes in visual function, along with visual acuity, visual field, standard electroretinography (ERG) results, and contrast sensitivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Eighteen patients diagnosed with RP were enrolled in this prospective, non-comparative, single-arm study from October 2010 to January 2011. Patients received supplementation with CGA 60 mg once per day. Patients that were already taking other anti-oxidants, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, were kept on their regimens. The best corrected visual acuity (measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letters), mERG (RETIscan System; Roland Consult, Brandenbrug, Germany), visual field (measured using Humphrey Field Analyzer [HFA] II [Carl Zeiss Meditech, Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA]), ERG, and contrast sensitivity (Vistech 6500 chart, Vistech Consultants, Inc., Dayton, OH, USA) were measured at baseline and then measured again after 3 months of CGA supplementation. RP patients with a residual visual field of less than 10 degrees in any direction on the visual field examination, a best corrected visual acuity of less than 50 ETDRS letters, a history of CGA supplementation within the prior 3 months, or abnormal liver enzyme (aspartate and alanine aminotrasferase &#x0003e; 40 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase &#x0003e; 130 IU/L), creatinine (&#x0003e; 1.4 mg/dL), or blood urea nitrogen levels (&#x0003e; 26 mg/dL) suggestive of liver or kidney dysfunction were excluded from the study.</p><p>The amplitude of each ring on mERG was evaluated as the primary outcome measure. The eye with the larger amplitude on ring 1 of mERG was selected for analysis. Additionally, the total point score on HFA with target size III was used for the visual field evaluation. Full-field ERG followed the guidelines of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>); rod-specific and standard bright flash ERG were both recorded after a minimum of 20 min of dark adaptation, and the photopic 30 Hz flicker and single flash cone response was recorded following 10 min of light adaptation. The full-field rod, cone and combined response amplitude was also studied as a secondary outcome measure. The log<sub>10</sub> (contrast sensitivity) at each spatial frequency (1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles/degree) was also used as a secondary outcome measure. Any systemic adverse effects and subjective improvement of vision were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>IBM SPSS Statistics 21 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analyses.

However, this study failed to show a significant improvement in visual outcome measurements after CGA supplementation.</p><p>Considering the pathophysiology of photoreceptor cell damage in hereditary retinal degeneration such as RP, various anti-oxidants have been recommended to delay progression in these patients. However, there are difficulties in evaluating the effect on the degree of progression for slowly progressing diseases like RP, as conducting clinical trials for extended periods of time and controlling dietary intake is challenging. Therefore, the effect of anti-oxidants in RP patients is generally based on theoretical background, while the evidence from clinical trials is sparse. Vitamin A has been found to decrease the rate of decline in ERG amplitude and marginally affect the rate of decline in the visual field area (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>). Docosahexaenoic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid, was found to have an additional benefit in patients naive to vitamin A supplementation in the initial 2 yr (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>). Lutein supplementation slowed the loss of the mid-peripheral visual field in nonsmoking adults with RP taking vitamin A (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>).</p><p>Peripheral ring 5 amplitude on mERG increased with CGA intake in our study. In a previous study (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>), mERG was suggested as an effective tool for the long-term follow-up of disease progression and as an objective outcome measure in studies evaluating treatment outcome in RP patients. Ring 5 amplitude was found to be strongly correlated with the scotopic ERG mixed cone-rod response amplitude, but only mildly correlated with the visual field area. Other previous studies evaluating the effect of antioxidants in RP have not utilized mERG as a visual function evaluation tool (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>). This increase in amplitude with CGA intake may indicate the possibility of a peripheral scotopic functional improvement effect, and raises the necessity of a long-term study verifying this effect of CGA using other more gross measurement tools, such as visual field measurement. Changes in mERG could be detected in Korean RP patients, who had been reported to have more advanced peripheral visual field defects, while central vision was more preserved (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>); these patients may be possible candidates to benefit most from CGA supplementation to improve peripheral visual function.</p><p>Previous studies that have noted the beneficial effect of anti-oxidants on the progression of RP have also identified improved visual function at the periphery of the retina, which is the site where degeneration occurs. Berson et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>) identified that lutein supplementation of 12 mg/d slowed the loss of the mid-peripheral visual field in nonsmoking adults with RP taking vitamin A. Our finding of improvement in the most-peripheral ring 5 amplitude on mERG is consistent with this hypothesis. There has only been 1 study to date that has reported a benefit in the preservation of central visual function, which was a long-term study of 4 to 6 yr of omega-3 supplementation in RP patients taking vitamin A (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>). Parameters associated with central visual function such as total point score on the central visual field examination on HFA, contrast sensitivity, and photopic 30-Hz flicker amplitude on ERG need a longer follow-up time, and as expected, showed no significant change with short-term CGA supplementation. In order to evaluate the possible benefits to central visual function, a long-term study with a supplementation period of several years should be conducted.</p><p>There are some shortcomings in this study. The follow-up period was short to evaluate the effects of nutrition supplementation, and the long-term benefit effect remains to be clarified. In addition, this study enrolled a small number of subjects with no control group, raising the possibility of bias. This study included a heterogeneous study population with various degrees of RP progression, various genetic types, altered proteins, and mutations. Another possible factor is that the diseases of patients included in this study were not very advanced, and the patients had considerably larger residual visual function. A randomized, placebo-controlled, long-term clinical trial in a large scale must be conducted to confirm the possible benefit of CGA supplementation in RP patients. Additionally, comparative studies among anti-oxidative agents may be necessary, and CGA should be considered as an anti-oxidant that can be used in the management of RP.</p><p>In conclusion, this study confirmed the objective effectiveness of CGA in RP patients, and a clinical benefit of anti-oxidant supplementation in RP. The increased activity in the peripheral retina may raise the possibility of delaying the progressive decline in visual function in hereditary retinal degeneration.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type=\"supported-by\"><p>This study was supported by a research grant from the company THEye Korea, Seoul, Korea (2010).</p></fn><fn fn-type=\"conflict\"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Some genetic changes may alter rod cells to be more susceptible to oxidative damage in the retina, which is exposed directly to the effects of light, leading to progressive retinal degeneration (1, 2). In other genetic mutations, rod cells may die from other primary processes; and then when the rod cells die, the oxygen content in the retina rises, causing oxidative stress and secondary degeneration of the remaining cone cells. The retina is highly metabolically active, and is therefore prone to oxidative damage. Various anti-oxidants have been considered as possible candidates that might delay this progression. There have been numerous reports on the effects of antioxidants in delaying the degeneration of photoreceptors in animal models of RP (3). Anti-oxidant supplementation has been found to be effective in the intervention of atrophic age-related macular degeneration (4). Human clinical trials for antioxidants such as vitamins A and E, lutein, and docosahexaenoic acid have been conducted for RP with some beneficial effects noted (5-8). Additionally, continuous modifications of anti-oxidant dosages and regimens have been tried as possible candidates for nutritional supplementation in RP. Recently, patients consuming a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and receiving 15,000 IU vitamin A daily were found to have a slower progression in decline of visual acuity over 4 to 6 yr (9), raising hope for a possible delay of progression in RP patients.\\n\\nChlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenol found in various agricultural products such as coffee, beans, potatoes, and apples, and is formed by the esterification of caffeic and quinic acids. The antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-carcinogenic activities of CGA have been demonstrated in many studies (10-13). CGA showed an anti-oxidant effect in vitro (14), in cultured human endothelial cells (15), and in rat models of ischemia/reperfusion injury to the liver (16). The beneficial effect of CGA in coffee has been suggested in a human study monitoring the oxidation of proteins, DNA membrane lipids, and other redox biomarkers (17). Several studies have also demonstrated its neuroprotective effect (18, 19).\\n\\nMultifocal electroretinography (mERG) has recently been evaluated as an objective electrophysiological method to evaluate changes in retinal function in RP patients (20). The response amplitude has been found to follow a similar exponential decay as the visual field and may provide reproducible responses, even if standard electroretinography (ERG) is nearly extinguished.\\n\\nIn order to evaluate the effect of CGA supplementation in patients with RP, we utilized mERG to objectively evaluate changes in visual function, along with visual acuity, visual field, standard electroretinography (ERG) results, and contrast sensitivity.\\n\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\n\\nStudy design\\n\\nEighteen patients diagnosed with RP were enrolled in this prospective, non-comparative, single-arm study from October 2010 to January 2011. Patients received supplementation with CGA 60 mg once per day. Patients that were already taking other anti-oxidants, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, were kept on their regimens. The best corrected visual acuity (measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letters), mERG (RETIscan System; Roland Consult, Brandenbrug, Germany), visual field (measured using Humphrey Field Analyzer [HFA] II [Carl Zeiss Meditech, Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA]), ERG, and contrast sensitivity (Vistech 6500 chart, Vistech Consultants, Inc., Dayton, OH, USA) were measured at baseline and then measured again after 3 months of CGA supplementation. RP patients with a residual visual field of less than 10 degrees in any direction on the visual field examination, a best corrected visual acuity of less than 50 ETDRS letters, a history of CGA supplementation within the prior 3 months, or abnormal liver enzyme (aspartate and alanine aminotrasferase > 40 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase > 130 IU/L), creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dL), or blood urea nitrogen levels (> 26 mg/dL) suggestive of liver or kidney dysfunction were excluded from the study.\\n\\nThe amplitude of each ring on mERG was evaluated as the primary outcome measure. The eye with the larger amplitude on ring 1 of mERG was selected for analysis. Additionally, the total point score on HFA with target size III was used for the visual field evaluation. Full-field ERG followed the guidelines of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) (21); rod-specific and standard bright flash ERG were both recorded after a minimum of 20 min of dark adaptation, and the photopic 30 Hz flicker and single flash cone response was recorded following 10 min of light adaptation. The full-field rod, cone and combined response amplitude was also studied as a secondary outcome measure. The log10 (contrast sensitivity) at each spatial frequency (1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles/degree) was also used as a secondary outcome measure. Any systemic adverse effects and subjective improvement of vision were also evaluated.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analyses\\n\\nIBM SPSS Statistics 21 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analyses. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for analysis of parameters before and after CGA supplementation. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\\n\\n\\nEthics statement\\n\\nThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. 1008-131-329), and the study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was confirmed by the board.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe demographic characteristics of the study patients are listed in Table 1. The mean age of the patients included in the study was 31.7 ± 9.9 yr. The mean visual acuity was 77.3 ± 9.0 letters.\\n\\nThe pre- and post-treatment measurements are compared in Table 2. There was no significant change in best corrected visual acuity, total point score on HFA, rod, cone and combined response amplitude on standard ERG, or contrast sensitivity; however, the amplitude of ring 5 on mERG was significantly higher after 3 months of CGA supplementation (7.2 ± 9.5 vs 8.3 ± 10.8 nV/deg2, mean ± standard deviation, P = 0.022, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (Fig. 1).\\n\\nNo systemic adverse events were noted with 3 months' supplementation of CGA. Five patients expressed a subjective improvement of visual function, while 12 patients said they experienced no change. No patients noticed deterioration of visual function during the study period.\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nThis study demonstrated that CGA significantly increased the amplitude of mERG, raising the possibility of a beneficial effect on the peripheral area at the margins of the retinal degeneration. However, this study failed to show a significant improvement in visual outcome measurements after CGA supplementation.\\n\\nConsidering the pathophysiology of photoreceptor cell damage in hereditary retinal degeneration such as RP, various anti-oxidants have been recommended to delay progression in these patients. However, there are difficulties in evaluating the effect on the degree of progression for slowly progressing diseases like RP, as conducting clinical trials for extended periods of time and controlling dietary intake is challenging. Therefore, the effect of anti-oxidants in RP patients is generally based on theoretical background, while the evidence from clinical trials is sparse. Vitamin A has been found to decrease the rate of decline in ERG amplitude and marginally affect the rate of decline in the visual field area (22). Docosahexaenoic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid, was found to have an additional benefit in patients naive to vitamin A supplementation in the initial 2 yr (8). Lutein supplementation slowed the loss of the mid-peripheral visual field in nonsmoking adults with RP taking vitamin A (5).\\n\\nPeripheral ring 5 amplitude on mERG increased with CGA intake in our study. In a previous study (20), mERG was suggested as an effective tool for the long-term follow-up of disease progression and as an objective outcome measure in studies evaluating treatment outcome in RP patients. Ring 5 amplitude was found to be strongly correlated with the scotopic ERG mixed cone-rod response amplitude, but only mildly correlated with the visual field area. Other previous studies evaluating the effect of antioxidants in RP have not utilized mERG as a visual function evaluation tool (5-9). This increase in amplitude with CGA intake may indicate the possibility of a peripheral scotopic functional improvement effect, and raises the necessity of a long-term study verifying this effect of CGA using other more gross measurement tools, such as visual field measurement. Changes in mERG could be detected in Korean RP patients, who had been reported to have more advanced peripheral visual field defects, while central vision was more preserved (23); these patients may be possible candidates to benefit most from CGA supplementation to improve peripheral visual function.\\n\\nPrevious studies that have noted the beneficial effect of anti-oxidants on the progression of RP have also identified improved visual function at the periphery of the retina, which is the site where degeneration occurs. Berson et al. (5) identified that lutein supplementation of 12 mg/d slowed the loss of the mid-peripheral visual field in nonsmoking adults with RP taking vitamin A. Our finding of improvement in the most-peripheral ring 5 amplitude on mERG is consistent with this hypothesis. There has only been 1 study to date that has reported a benefit in the preservation of central visual function, which was a long-term study of 4 to 6 yr of omega-3 supplementation in RP patients taking vitamin A (9). Parameters associated with central visual function such as total point score on the central visual field examination on HFA, contrast sensitivity, and photopic 30-Hz flicker amplitude on ERG need a longer follow-up time, and as expected, showed no significant change with short-term CGA supplementation. In order to evaluate the possible benefits to central visual function, a long-term study with a supplementation period of several years should be conducted.\\n\\nThere are some shortcomings in this study. The follow-up period was short to evaluate the effects of nutrition supplementation, and the long-term benefit effect remains to be clarified. In addition, this study enrolled a small number of subjects with no control group, raising the possibility of bias. This study included a heterogeneous study population with various degrees of RP progression, various genetic types, altered proteins, and mutations. Another possible factor is that the diseases of patients included in this study were not very advanced, and the patients had considerably larger residual visual function. A randomized, placebo-controlled, long-term clinical trial in a large scale must be conducted to confirm the possible benefit of CGA supplementation in RP patients. Additionally, comparative studies among anti-oxidative agents may be necessary, and CGA should be considered as an anti-oxidant that can be used in the management of RP.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this study confirmed the objective effectiveness of CGA in RP patients, and a clinical benefit of anti-oxidant supplementation in RP. The increased activity in the peripheral retina may raise the possibility of delaying the progressive decline in visual function in hereditary retinal degeneration.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Chlorogenic Acid Supplementation Improves Multifocal Electroretinography in Patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'journal_title': 'Journal of Korean Medical Science'}\n",

One of the proposed mechanisms underlying this risk association is the change in adipokines expression that could promote the development and progression of the prostate tumor cells. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of preadipocyte and adipocyte secretome in the proliferation, migration and invasion of androgen independent prostate carcinoma cells (RM1) and to assess cell proliferation in the presence of the adiposity signals leptin and insulin. RM1 cells were co-cultured in with preadipocytes, adipocytes or cultured in their respective conditioned medium. Cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry and XTT viability test. Cell migration was evaluated using a wound healing injury assay of RM1 cells cultured with conditioned media. Cellular invasion of RM1 cells co-cultured with adipocytes and preadipocytes was assessed using matrigel membranes. Preadipocyte conditioned medium was associated with a small increase in RM1 proliferation, while adipocytes conditioned media significantly increased RM1 cell proliferation (p&#x0003c;0.01). Adipocytes also significantly increased the RM1 cells proliferation in co-culture (p &#x0003c;0.01). Cell migration was higher in RM1 cells cultured with preadipocyte and adipocyte conditioned medium. RM1 cell invasion was significantly increased after co-culture with preadipocytes and adipocytes (p &#x0003c;0.05). Insulin also increased significantly the cell proliferation in contrast to leptin, which showed no effect. In conclusion, prostate carcinoma cells seem to be influenced by factors secreted by adipocytes that are able to increase their ability to proliferate, migrate and invade.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants Fcomp-01-0124-FEDER-015893 of the Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia (FCT) of Portugal to The Unit for Multidisciplinary Research in Biomedicine (UMIB) and by a research grant from the Sociedade Portuguesa de Endocrinologia Diabetes e Metabolismo (SPEDM) to &#x000c2;ngela Moreira.

Typically, prostate cancer cells are initially androgen dependent, but can become androgen-independent with the progression of the disease to a more advanced and aggressive stage, leading to a worse prognosis [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref003\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>].</p><p>Several risk factors for prostate cancer have already been firmly identified. These include elder age, family history, race/ethnicity, geographic location, while other potential risk factors such as diet, obesity, insulin resistance and androgens levels have also been implicated [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref004\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Acquired or inherited genetic alterations in tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes or genes associated with angiogenesis and cell cycle also appear to be associated with the risk of developing prostate cancer and the aggressiveness of the tumor [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref003\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>].</p><p>Among the numerous modifiable factors that have been implicated in the risk of development of prostate cancer, obesity is the one that has been the focus of the most intensive research given the fact that present knowledge does not allow definitive recommendations. The clarification of the underling mechanisms could lead to specific preventative interventions [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref004\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Obesity results from a complex interaction of genetic predisposition and the environment, with increased caloric intake and decreased physical activity, leading to chronic energy imbalance and expansion of dysfunctional adipose tissue mass [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref005\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref007\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, with more than one billion of adults being overweight, of which at least 300 million are obese worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref008\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>]. While it is estimated that these figures will continue to increase in the forth coming years [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref006\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref009\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>].</p><p>Adipose tissue is a metabolically active organ involved in energy homeostasis, immunity and endocrine balance [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref010\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. In obesity and in particular in visceral or abdominal obesity, the adipose tissue becomes dysfunctional contributing to the development of several pathologic conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref011\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]. Although still controversial, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of developing esophagus, colorectal cancer, breast and prostate cancer [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref009\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref010\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. Obesity has also been associated with an increased risk of mortality from cancer of 52% and 88% in men and women, respectively [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref012\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref013\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>]. In particular, obese men have an increased risk of disease progression after radical prostatectomy and are more likely to develop metastasis or die from prostate cancer compared to normal weight men. This supports the hypothesis that obesity is associated with a more aggressive prostate tumor biology [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref014\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. Furthermore, a high density of peri-prostatic adipose tissue has also been associated with more aggressive forms of prostate tumors and poor prognosis [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref015\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref016\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>]. These observations also suggest that obesity is more related to the aggressiveness of the tumors and not directly related to the risk of development of prostate cancer [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref017\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref019\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. Tumor progression seems to depend not only on the tumor itself but also on the surrounding microenvironment [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref016\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref020\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]. Prostate tumor cells have been shown to be able to change their surrounding adipocyte phenotype by inducing loss of lipid content, increasing the metabolic activity, and altering the adipokines and adipocyte markers expression, which in turn may promote tumor cell growth [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref021\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>].</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between obesity and prostate cancer. For example, the increased levels of estrogens, insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref010\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref022\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>], as well as changes in the immune response and adipokines expression [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref012\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref023\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>], which lead to a pro-inflammatory state, triggering DNA damage and angiogenesis that could result in increased tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion and metastasis [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref010\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>].</p><p>Several adipokines, such as leptin, IGF 1, interleukin 6 (IL 6) and Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are increased in obesity [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref014\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. These have been demonstrated to interfere with several signaling pathways and have mitogenic effects. Consequently, they have been implicated in the risk of development and progression of prostate cancer in the obese state [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref024\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref025\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>].</p><p>The identification of the adiposity associated factors that could promote the proliferation and survival of prostate tumor cells is important to not allow the establishment of recommendations for preventive interventions and the development of targeted therapies for obesity associated prostate cancer. Therefore, the main goal of our study was to assess the effects of preadipocyte and adipocyte secreted factors in the proliferation, migration and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells, and the effects of the adiposity signals, insulin and leptin, in cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\" id=\"sec002\"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id=\"sec003\"><title>Cell cultures</title><p>RM1 androgen independent prostate carcinoma cells belong to a murine cell line (mouse prostate reconstitution, MPR)[<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref026\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>] kindly offered by Prof T.

Although controversial, this disease association varies considerably according to the tumor location. For example, in tumors located in organs surrounded by adipose tissue [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref011\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref027\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>] the correlation is higher.</p><p>One of the suggested mechanisms for the obesity-associated risk of cancer is the chronic inflammatory state that characterizes obesity with increased expression of pro-inflammatory adipokines and species reactive oxygen (ROS) that could promote tumor progression, invasion and metastasis [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref011\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]. The purpose of this research work was to study the influence of adipocyte produced signals in the proliferation, invasion and migration of androgen independent prostate cancer cells.</p><p>The adipose tissue is known to participate in the metabolism of androgens, a well characterized stimulus for prostate cell growth, which could influence prostate cancer growth. Therefore, an androgen independent prostate cancer cell line was chosen as a model, in order to exclude the influence of sex steroids [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref028\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The role of adipokines in androgen-independent prostate cancer progression is also controversial and warrants further clarification if we consider that some authors argue that the effect of adipokines in tumor progression is higher in androgen-independent cells [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref014\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>], while others claim that mechanisms other than adipokines should be the main proliferation triggers [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref011\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>].</p><p>After selecting an initial cell concentration that displayed an exponential growth curve and without reaching the latent phase to evaluate the effect of preadipocyte and adipocyte secreted factors on prostate cancer cell proliferation, RM1 cells were cultured in the presence of different conditioned media collected from preadipocyte and adipocyte cultures. Adipocytes conditioned medium were obtained after differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using a hormonal cocktail added to the culture medium capable of activating two transcription factors, CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein &#x003b2; and &#x003b4;. In turn, such factors stimulate the expression of adipocyte differentiation regulators, Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein &#x003b1; (C/EBP&#x003b1;), which induce adipogenesis transcription factors and expression of genes that determine the adipocyte characteristics [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref029\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref030\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. Cell proliferation was assessed 24h later by the XTT indirect method that was used in alternative to the Alamar Blue method since the conditioned media was shown to interfere in the mechanism of the latter (personal data not shown). The preadipocyte conditioned media induced a non-significant increase in RM1 cell proliferation while adipocyte conditioned media caused a significant increase in proliferation when compared with control. This suggests that adipocyte secreted factors are able to interfere with prostate carcinoma cells proliferation as suggested by previous studies performed with DU145, PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref031\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>]. It also corroborates the theory that proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells are influenced by adipocytes [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref021\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref032\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>]. Prostate cancer cell proliferation in co-culture with preadipocytes and adipocytes, so as to allow the diffusion of soluble factors and cell crosstalk but not direct heterotypic cell-cell contact, was found to be both significantly increased. Despite of this cell proliferation was significantly higher in cells co-cultured with adipocytes. These results are also in agreement with what has already been described by other authors who also found that the adipocytes where able to increase tumor cell proliferation [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref033\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref035\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>] using prostate cancer cells and other types of tumor cells, in particular from colon and breast cancer.</p><p>Obesity has also been associated with the risk of prostate cancer progression and higher aggressiveness of the tumors. To test this hypothesis, the influence of adipocyte secreted factors in the capacity of migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells has been evaluated. Preadipocyte and adipocyte conditioned media significantly increased RM1 cell migration when compared with the control media results which are also consistent with previous migration studies performed using other prostate carcinoma cell lines. Such studies found that adipocyte conditioned media and sera from obese mice increased the migration rate of cancer cells cultured [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref014\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref036\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>]. Our results further suggest that, although less prominent, preadipocytes also appear to be able to produce factors that can stimulate the motility and migration of prostate carcinoma cells, even though the specific signals, growth factors and cytokines involved in this mechanism are still to be identified.</p><p>Our studies have also shown that prostate cancer cells invasiveness capacity is significantly increased when cultured in the presence of preadipocytes and adipocytes. However, it is significantly higher in cells cultured in the presence of adipocytes. Thus, adipocyte secreted factors appear to be able to stimulate the migration and invasiveness of androgen-independent tumor cells, an effect that may be mediated by adipokines that either are not secreted or are secreted in smaller amounts by preadipocytes [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref034\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. These effects had already been reported using other prostate carcinoma cell lines, as well as for other types of cancer cells, such as breast and ovarian cancer, which have also demonstrated to display an increased invasiveness capacity when cultured with adipocytes or their respective conditioned media [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref015\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref020\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref037\" ref-type=\"bibr\">37</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref038\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. Our results support the hypothesis that adipocyte secreted factors can enhance prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration and that these effects can be triggered not only by systemic mediators, such as insulin or cytokines secreted by the inflammatory cells in the adipose tissue, but also by specific and still unidentified adipocyte secreted molecules potentially produced by the interaction of tumor cells and with their microenvironment [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref014\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref033\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref035\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref038\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>].</p><p>Although only leptin is secreted by the adipocyte cell, both, insulin and leptin, are the predominant adiposity signals in circulation [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref024\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref039\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>], and therefore were chosen to assess the effects of obesity associated endocrine signals in prostate cancer cell proliferation. After having demonstrated in a previous study that RM1 prostate cancer cells express both leptin and insulin receptors [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref007\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>], in the present study we show that high insulin concentrations (1600nmol / L) are able to trigger a significant increase in RM1 cell proliferation rate in the first 12h after incubation, when compared with lower concentrations (0 and 200 nmol/L) previously tested by us [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref040\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. However, from 24h of insulin stimulation onwards, there no significant differences in proliferation were observed, most likely due to large variation observed. Since this variability was not observed in any of the previous studies in the absence of insulin, a possible explanation for the variation observed from 24h onwards after insulin stimulation is the heterogeneity of the cancer cell population, in result of the anaplastic nature of the cancer cell line with variable degrees of cellular differentiation, which might have resulted in different time lags in the response to the proliferation stimuli. These findings are in accordance with the results by Heidegger et al. that showed that insulin is able to stimulate LNCaP androgen-dependent and DU-145 and PC-3 androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref039\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Nonetheless, the same authors have also suggested that other signaling molecules such as IGF-1, may also be involved in the mechanism of insulin stimulated cell proliferation of prostate carcinoma [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref039\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref041\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>], which binds to its own receptor Insulin like growth factor 1 receptor-IGFR but also to the insulin receptor (IR) and thereby activates two routes that promote proliferation [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref042\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref>]. Our results also support the hypothesis that high insulin concentrations might be able to activate mechanisms that increase cell survival and prostate cancer progression after androgens inactivation therapy or in castration-resistant forms [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref043\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, leptin in the different tested concentrations was not found to interfere significantly in prostate cancer cell proliferation. This is consistent with our previous results [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref040\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>] in spite of the fact that other authors have demonstrated the pro-proliferative effects of leptin in androgen independent prostate carcinoma cells [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref024\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>] and a risk association of high leptin levels in circulation with prostate cancer aggressiveness [<xref rid=\"pone.0123217.ref044\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>].</p><p>In summary, in the herein study, we demonstrate for the first time that adipocyte secreted factors are able to mediate pro-proliferative effects on prostate cancer cells, independently of mediators produced by other cell populations resident within the adipose tissue, such as inflammatory cells, which could also be responsible for driving these effects. Moreover, we have evaluated in the same experimental conditions the effects of adipocyte secreted factors on cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness, having demonstrated that these are able to mediate each of these phenomena. Since prostate cancer cells increased proliferation, migration and invasiveness, could all together contribute to enhance disease aggressiveness, this data thus supports the hypothesis that obesity can contribute to increase the risk of progression and aggressiveness of prostate cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Andreia Ribeiro, MSc, for training support in cell culture and Daniela Vasconcelos, Msc, for assistance in invasion assays.

sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1], and the most common cancer in males, in Europe [2].\\n\\nProstate cancer is often an indolent disease, however 30% of the tumors become aggressive [3]. Typically, prostate cancer cells are initially androgen dependent, but can become androgen-independent with the progression of the disease to a more advanced and aggressive stage, leading to a worse prognosis [3].\\n\\nSeveral risk factors for prostate cancer have already been firmly identified. These include elder age, family history, race/ethnicity, geographic location, while other potential risk factors such as diet, obesity, insulin resistance and androgens levels have also been implicated [4]. Acquired or inherited genetic alterations in tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes or genes associated with angiogenesis and cell cycle also appear to be associated with the risk of developing prostate cancer and the aggressiveness of the tumor [3].\\n\\nAmong the numerous modifiable factors that have been implicated in the risk of development of prostate cancer, obesity is the one that has been the focus of the most intensive research given the fact that present knowledge does not allow definitive recommendations. The clarification of the underling mechanisms could lead to specific preventative interventions [4]. Obesity results from a complex interaction of genetic predisposition and the environment, with increased caloric intake and decreased physical activity, leading to chronic energy imbalance and expansion of dysfunctional adipose tissue mass [5–7]. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, with more than one billion of adults being overweight, of which at least 300 million are obese worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [8]. While it is estimated that these figures will continue to increase in the forth coming years [6,9].\\n\\nAdipose tissue is a metabolically active organ involved in energy homeostasis, immunity and endocrine balance [10]. In obesity and in particular in visceral or abdominal obesity, the adipose tissue becomes dysfunctional contributing to the development of several pathologic conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer [11]. Although still controversial, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of developing esophagus, colorectal cancer, breast and prostate cancer [9,10]. Obesity has also been associated with an increased risk of mortality from cancer of 52% and 88% in men and women, respectively [12,13]. In particular, obese men have an increased risk of disease progression after radical prostatectomy and are more likely to develop metastasis or die from prostate cancer compared to normal weight men. This supports the hypothesis that obesity is associated with a more aggressive prostate tumor biology [14]. Furthermore, a high density of peri-prostatic adipose tissue has also been associated with more aggressive forms of prostate tumors and poor prognosis [15,16]. These observations also suggest that obesity is more related to the aggressiveness of the tumors and not directly related to the risk of development of prostate cancer [17–19]. Tumor progression seems to depend not only on the tumor itself but also on the surrounding microenvironment [16,20]. Prostate tumor cells have been shown to be able to change their surrounding adipocyte phenotype by inducing loss of lipid content, increasing the metabolic activity, and altering the adipokines and adipocyte markers expression, which in turn may promote tumor cell growth [21].\\n\\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between obesity and prostate cancer. For example, the increased levels of estrogens, insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) [10,22], as well as changes in the immune response and adipokines expression [12,23], which lead to a pro-inflammatory state, triggering DNA damage and angiogenesis that could result in increased tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion and metastasis [10].\\n\\nSeveral adipokines, such as leptin, IGF 1, interleukin 6 (IL 6) and Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are increased in obesity [14]. These have been demonstrated to interfere with several signaling pathways and have mitogenic effects. Consequently, they have been implicated in the risk of development and progression of prostate cancer in the obese state [24,25].\\n\\nThe identification of the adiposity associated factors that could promote the proliferation and survival of prostate tumor cells is important to not allow the establishment of recommendations for preventive interventions and the development of targeted therapies for obesity associated prostate cancer. Therefore, the main goal of our study was to assess the effects of preadipocyte and adipocyte secreted factors in the proliferation, migration and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells, and the effects of the adiposity signals, insulin and leptin, in cell proliferation.\\n\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\n\\nCell cultures\\n\\nRM1 androgen independent prostate carcinoma cells belong to a murine cell line (mouse prostate reconstitution, MPR)[26] kindly offered by Prof T. Thompson from MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. The cell cultures were performed according to the protocol previously published and implemented by our research group [7]. Cancer cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) High Glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1% Penicillin- streptomycin (Pen-Strep) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 50mM Hepes buffer solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Every time cells became 90% confluent, the cell culture was split by incubating the cells with 0.25% trypsin- Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). To determine the number of cells at each passage, the viable cells were counted using the Trypan Blue (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) exclusion assay on a Neubaeur Chamber. Passages 12, 13 and 14 (P12, 13, 14) were used for this study.\\n\\n3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line was purchased from a commercial supplier (Zen- Bio, Durham, NC, USA) (passage 14 and 15) was cultured in DMEM High Glucose (Sigma- Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% Newborn Calf Serum (NCS) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1% Pen-Strep and 50mM Hepes buffer was used as basal medium. Cells were grown in 25cm2 flasks (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) until reaching 70% confluence when they were passaged by incubating the cells with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution. Adipocyte differentiation was induced two days after the cells reached full confluence. For that, the culture medium were removed, cells were washed with 1% phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (Gibco, Life technologies, USA) and incubated with DMEM-F12 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine and 1% Pen-Strep, and a differentiation cocktail containing 1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 0.5 mM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine- IBMX (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 1 μg/ml human insulin (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark). After 72h, the medium were replaced by DMEM-F12 supplemented as described above plus 1μg/ml insulin. Afterwards, cells were re-fed every 48h with DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Pen-Strep.\\n\\nAll cell cultures were handled in a laminar flow chamber and maintained at 37°C in an incubator (Heracell 150i, Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA USA) with 5% CO2.\\n\\n\\nDetermination of cell growth curves\\n\\nRM1 cell proliferation was assessed using the indirect method for estimating cell number based on the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, which reduces sodium 2,3-bis[2-Methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide inner salt) (XTT) (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) dye to formazan.\\n\\nGrowth curves were performed using three different initial RM1 cell concentrations 2x104 /mL, 5x104/mL, 10x104/mL or cell culture medium only used as blank control, in five replicates (5 wells) for each concentration seeded into 96 well plate (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), in order to determine the optimal RM1 cell concentration to use in the subsequent studies. At each time point, 40 μL (20% culture media volume) of XTT reagent was added to each well and the absorbance was measured 12, 24, 36 and 48h in a plate reader at 450 and 620nm, at the several times points. The absorbance at 620 nm was used as a background measurement and was subtracted to the 450 nm absorbance value.\\n\\nThe cell proliferation was estimated by the percentage of XTT reduction calculated using the following equation:%\\n\\nR\\n\\ne\\n\\nd\\n\\nu\\n\\nc\\n\\nt\\n\\ni\\n\\no\\n\\nn\\n\\n=\\n\\n(A450−A620)\\n\\n/A\\n\\nB\\n\\n450\\n\\n\\nCell proliferation assays\\n\\nAfter determining the ideal initial RM1 cell concentration (5x104 cell/mL) to be used in the subsequent studies, the effect of adipocyte and preadipocyte conditioned media in RM1 cell proliferation was evaluated.\\n\\nTo examine the effect of preadipocytes and adipocytes secretome on RM1 cell proliferation, preadipocytes serum free conditioned culture medium (PACM) was collected 24h after being in culture, while adipocytes serum free conditioned culture medium (ACM) was collected after 24h and 48h after being in culture. Both media were stored at -80°C until use. RM1 cells (5x104 mL/well; P12, 13, 14) were seeded in five replicates into 96 well plates (BD Falcon) and incubated for 12 hours in complete media, after which the medium was removed and replaced by conditioned media (24h preadipocyte and 24h and 48h adipocyte conditioned media) for 24h. Preadipocyte and adipocyte basal serum free media (DMEM High glucose supplemented with 1% Pen-strep, 50mM Hepes Buffer and DMEM-F12 supplemented with 1% Pen-strep, respectively) were used as negative controls. After 24h, 40μL of XTT reagent was added to each well and the absorbance was measured as previously described.\\n\\nTo examine the effect of preadipocytes and adipocytes in co-culture with RM1 in prostate cancer cell proliferation, 24-well transwell culture system plate with 0.4 μm pore size Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane (Corning incorporated Life Sciences, St. Lowell, MA,USA) were used. Preadipocytes and adipocytes were cultured in the bottom chamber, while RM1 cells (4x104/well) were seeded in the upper chamber of the transwell system. To evaluated RM1 cell proliferation, 24 hours after incubation, cells were detached, suspended in 1% PBS/ 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) / 5mM EDTA buffer solution and counted in a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA) using cell counting beads (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).\\n\\nTo evaluate the effect of insulin and leptin on the proliferation of RM1 cells the resazurin reduction method was used. For that RM1 cells were seeded (5x104cel/mL) and cultured with different human insulin (0 nmol/L, 200nmol/L, 800nmol/L and 1600nmol/L) (Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) or leptin (0ng/mL, 10ng/mL, 50ng/mL and 100ng/mL) (H-5582, rec leptin, Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) concentrations that were added to the culture media together with 100μL of resazurin reagent- alamar blue (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK). Five replicates for each concentration and negative control containing medium culture only and resazurin reagent were used, and the absorbance was measured at each time point (0, 12, 24 and 36h) at 570 and 595 nm. The percentage of resazurin reduction was calculated using the following equation:\\n%Reduction=((Eoxλ2xAλ1−Eoxλ1xAλ2)/(Eredλ1xAblankλ2−Eredλ2xAblankλ1))x100\\nbeing λ2 = 595 nm, λ1 = 570 nm, Eox570nm = 80,573, Eox595nm = 117,216, Ered570nm = 155,667 and Ered595nm = 14,652.\\n\\n\\nMigration assay\\n\\nRM1 cells were seeded in 12 well plates and cultured in complete media until reaching 80% confluence. After that, a “wound” was produced in each well by scratching down the center of the well using a pipette tip, and the culture medium were replaced by preadipocyte and adipocyte conditioned media or complete media (negative control), using 3 replicates for each condition. Cellular migration was assessed by measuring the rate of “wound healing” by measuring the distance between the edges of the scratched region at 0h and 24h using image J software (originated at the National Institutes of Health, USA) in images captured at 100x using an Motic AE31 inverted microscopes (Motic, Hong Kong, China) with a digital camera (Motican 5.0 MP, Motic) and Motic Image Plus 2.0 ML software (Motic, Hong Kong, China).\\n\\n\\nCellular invasion assay\\n\\nTo evaluate the invasion capacity of RM1 cells, cell culture inserts with an 8.0μm pore size membrane (BD Biocoat 24-well Matrigel Chambers, BD Bioscience Bedford, MA, USA), were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\\n\\n3T3-L1 cells were seeded in the bottom chamber of the well, cultivated and half of the cell cultures were differentiated into adipocytes according to the protocol previously described and after completion of adipocytes differentiation, the culture media of preadipocytes and adipocytes was replaced by serum free media. Three replicates have been used for each condition, cell free culture media was used as negative control and adipocyte basal media supplemented with 30% FBS was used as positive control.\\n\\nMatrigel-coated inserts pre-incubated for 1 h with serum-free DMEM/DMEM-F12 were placed in the wells and RM1 cells (4x104 cells/well) were seeded in the upper chamber and cultured in the same conditions of the bottom chamber. After 24 hours, the media was collected, the inserts were washed with PBS 1% and the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% for 15 min at room temperature. Cells on the top surface of the filters were wiped off with cotton swabs and the membrane was carefully cut and mounted in a slide with DAPI-Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA). For each membrane, ten images (200x) were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Bx 41, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with an Olympus DP 70 digital camera and DP controller 2.1.1.183 Olympus software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The number of cell nuclei in each image was counted using the software Image J and the migration rate was estimated by taking into account the area of the field of view and the total area of the membrane.\\n\\nFor each assay to evaluate proliferation, migration and invasion, different controls have been used for preadipocytes and adipocytes, to minimize the interference of medium, since these cell cultures have different basal media.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nFor each condition mean, standard error of the mean (SEM) and normality were calculated. To compare two independent experimental groups, T Student test or Mann-Whitney were used, considering whether the sample followed a normal distribution or not. For three or more independent groups with normal distribution, a simple analysis of variance (one way ANOVA) with post-hoc Newman Keuls test was used or an Anova Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn's was performed when the sample failed to have a normal distribution.\\n\\nA p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis were performed using Excel and GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jola, CA) version 5 for Windows.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nRM1 cell proliferation\\n\\nThe RM1 cell growth curve, performed by the XTT method, to choose the optimal cell concentration to be used in the studies to assess cell proliferation, has shown that the initial concentration of 5×104cells/mL displayed a linear increase in the % of tetrazolium salt reduction, in the time interval to be used in most of the subsequent studies (Fig 1).\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0123217.g001Fig 1 RM1 cell growth curve.Growth curve using three different initial cell concentrations (2x104, 5x104, 10x104 cells/mL) evaluated by the determination of the percentage of tetrazolium salt reduction at different time points (12, 24, 36 and 48h).\\n\\nThe effects of preadipocyte conditioned media (PACM) and adipocyte conditioned media (ACM) (24h and 48h) on RM1 cell proliferation was measured by % XTT reduction.

After 24h, there were no significant differences due to the larger variations (Fig 4A).

Representative images of the cells invading the matrigel membrane for each tested condition (B).\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nSeveral epidemiological studies have suggested that there is an association among cancer incidence, mortality and obesity. Although controversial, this disease association varies considerably according to the tumor location. For example, in tumors located in organs surrounded by adipose tissue [11,27] the correlation is higher.\\n\\nOne of the suggested mechanisms for the obesity-associated risk of cancer is the chronic inflammatory state that characterizes obesity with increased expression of pro-inflammatory adipokines and species reactive oxygen (ROS) that could promote tumor progression, invasion and metastasis [11]. The purpose of this research work was to study the influence of adipocyte produced signals in the proliferation, invasion and migration of androgen independent prostate cancer cells.\\n\\nThe adipose tissue is known to participate in the metabolism of androgens, a well characterized stimulus for prostate cell growth, which could influence prostate cancer growth. Therefore, an androgen independent prostate cancer cell line was chosen as a model, in order to exclude the influence of sex steroids [28]. The role of adipokines in androgen-independent prostate cancer progression is also controversial and warrants further clarification if we consider that some authors argue that the effect of adipokines in tumor progression is higher in androgen-independent cells [14], while others claim that mechanisms other than adipokines should be the main proliferation triggers [11].\\n\\nAfter selecting an initial cell concentration that displayed an exponential growth curve and without reaching the latent phase to evaluate the effect of preadipocyte and adipocyte secreted factors on prostate cancer cell proliferation, RM1 cells were cultured in the presence of different conditioned media collected from preadipocyte and adipocyte cultures. Adipocytes conditioned medium were obtained after differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using a hormonal cocktail added to the culture medium capable of activating two transcription factors, CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein β and δ. In turn, such factors stimulate the expression of adipocyte differentiation regulators, Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), which induce adipogenesis transcription factors and expression of genes that determine the adipocyte characteristics [29,30]. Cell proliferation was assessed 24h later by the XTT indirect method that was used in alternative to the Alamar Blue method since the conditioned media was shown to interfere in the mechanism of the latter (personal data not shown). The preadipocyte conditioned media induced a non-significant increase in RM1 cell proliferation while adipocyte conditioned media caused a significant increase in proliferation when compared with control. This suggests that adipocyte secreted factors are able to interfere with prostate carcinoma cells proliferation as suggested by previous studies performed with DU145, PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines [31]. It also corroborates the theory that proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells are influenced by adipocytes [21,32]. Prostate cancer cell proliferation in co-culture with preadipocytes and adipocytes, so as to allow the diffusion of soluble factors and cell crosstalk but not direct heterotypic cell-cell contact, was found to be both significantly increased. Despite of this cell proliferation was significantly higher in cells co-cultured with adipocytes. These results are also in agreement with what has already been described by other authors who also found that the adipocytes where able to increase tumor cell proliferation [33–35] using prostate cancer cells and other types of tumor cells, in particular from colon and breast cancer.\\n\\nObesity has also been associated with the risk of prostate cancer progression and higher aggressiveness of the tumors. To test this hypothesis, the influence of adipocyte secreted factors in the capacity of migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells has been evaluated. Preadipocyte and adipocyte conditioned media significantly increased RM1 cell migration when compared with the control media results which are also consistent with previous migration studies performed using other prostate carcinoma cell lines. Such studies found that adipocyte conditioned media and sera from obese mice increased the migration rate of cancer cells cultured [14,36]. Our results further suggest that, although less prominent, preadipocytes also appear to be able to produce factors that can stimulate the motility and migration of prostate carcinoma cells, even though the specific signals, growth factors and cytokines involved in this mechanism are still to be identified.\\n\\nOur studies have also shown that prostate cancer cells invasiveness capacity is significantly increased when cultured in the presence of preadipocytes and adipocytes. However, it is significantly higher in cells cultured in the presence of adipocytes. Thus, adipocyte secreted factors appear to be able to stimulate the migration and invasiveness of androgen-independent tumor cells, an effect that may be mediated by adipokines that either are not secreted or are secreted in smaller amounts by preadipocytes [34]. These effects had already been reported using other prostate carcinoma cell lines, as well as for other types of cancer cells, such as breast and ovarian cancer, which have also demonstrated to display an increased invasiveness capacity when cultured with adipocytes or their respective conditioned media [15,20,37,38]. Our results support the hypothesis that adipocyte secreted factors can enhance prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration and that these effects can be triggered not only by systemic mediators, such as insulin or cytokines secreted by the inflammatory cells in the adipose tissue, but also by specific and still unidentified adipocyte secreted molecules potentially produced by the interaction of tumor cells and with their microenvironment [14,33,35,38].\\n\\nAlthough only leptin is secreted by the adipocyte cell, both, insulin and leptin, are the predominant adiposity signals in circulation [24,39], and therefore were chosen to assess the effects of obesity associated endocrine signals in prostate cancer cell proliferation. After having demonstrated in a previous study that RM1 prostate cancer cells express both leptin and insulin receptors [7], in the present study we show that high insulin concentrations (1600nmol / L) are able to trigger a significant increase in RM1 cell proliferation rate in the first 12h after incubation, when compared with lower concentrations (0 and 200 nmol/L) previously tested by us [40]. However, from 24h of insulin stimulation onwards, there no significant differences in proliferation were observed, most likely due to large variation observed. Since this variability was not observed in any of the previous studies in the absence of insulin, a possible explanation for the variation observed from 24h onwards after insulin stimulation is the heterogeneity of the cancer cell population, in result of the anaplastic nature of the cancer cell line with variable degrees of cellular differentiation, which might have resulted in different time lags in the response to the proliferation stimuli. These findings are in accordance with the results by Heidegger et al. that showed that insulin is able to stimulate LNCaP androgen-dependent and DU-145 and PC-3 androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation [39]. Nonetheless, the same authors have also suggested that other signaling molecules such as IGF-1, may also be involved in the mechanism of insulin stimulated cell proliferation of prostate carcinoma [39,41], which binds to its own receptor Insulin like growth factor 1 receptor-IGFR but also to the insulin receptor (IR) and thereby activates two routes that promote proliferation [42]. Our results also support the hypothesis that high insulin concentrations might be able to activate mechanisms that increase cell survival and prostate cancer progression after androgens inactivation therapy or in castration-resistant forms [43].\\n\\nIn contrast, leptin in the different tested concentrations was not found to interfere significantly in prostate cancer cell proliferation. This is consistent with our previous results [40] in spite of the fact that other authors have demonstrated the pro-proliferative effects of leptin in androgen independent prostate carcinoma cells [24] and a risk association of high leptin levels in circulation with prostate cancer aggressiveness [44].\\n\\nIn summary, in the herein study, we demonstrate for the first time that adipocyte secreted factors are able to mediate pro-proliferative effects on prostate cancer cells, independently of mediators produced by other cell populations resident within the adipose tissue, such as inflammatory cells, which could also be responsible for driving these effects. Moreover, we have evaluated in the same experimental conditions the effects of adipocyte secreted factors on cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness, having demonstrated that these are able to mediate each of these phenomena. Since prostate cancer cells increased proliferation, migration and invasiveness, could all together contribute to enhance disease aggressiveness, this data thus supports the hypothesis that obesity can contribute to increase the risk of progression and aggressiveness of prostate cancer.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Adipocyte Secreted Factors Enhance Aggressiveness of Prostate Carcinoma Cells', 'journal_title': 'PLoS ONE'}\n",

These demonstrations are designed to test innovative marketing techniques, benefit packages, and reimbursement levels. HCFA\\'s current method for prospective payments to HMOs is based on the Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC). An important issue in prospective reimbursement is the extent to which the AAPCC adequately reflects the risk factors which arise out of the selection process of Medicare beneficiaries into HMOs. This study examines the pre-enrollment reimbursement experience of Medicare beneficiaries who enrolled in the demonstration HMOs to determine whether or not a non-random selection process took place.</p><p>The three demonstration HMOs included in the study are the Fallon Community Health Plan, the Greater Marshfield Community Health Plan, and the Kaiser-Permanente medical program of Portland, Oregon. The study includes 18,085 aged Medicare beneficiaries who had enrolled in the three plans as of April, 1981. We included comparison groups consisting of a 5 percent random sample of aged Medicare beneficiaries (N = 11,240) living in the same geographic areas as the control groups. The study compares the groups by total Medicare reimbursements for the years 1976 through 1979. Adjustments were made for AAPCC factor differences in the groups (age, sex, institutional status, and welfare status).</p><p>In two of the HMO areas there was evidence of a selection process among the HMOs enrollees. Enrollees in the Fallon and Kaiser health plans were found to have had 20 percent lower Medicare reimbursements than their respective comparison groups in the four years prior to enrollment. This effect was strongest for inpatient services, but a significant difference also existed for use of physician and outpatient services.</p><p>In the Marshfield HMO there was no statistically significant difference in pre-enrollment Medicare total reimbursements between the enrollee and comparison groups. However, outpatient and physician reimbursements were significantly higher (22 percent) among the enrollee group.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that the AAPCC may not be an adequate mechanism for setting prospective reimbursement rates. The Marshfield results further suggest that the type of HMO may have an influence on the selection process among Medicare beneficiaries. If Medicare beneficiaries do not have to change providers to join an HMO, as in an IPA model or a staff model which includes most of the providers in an area, the selection process may be more likely to result in an unbiased risk group.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type=\"intro\"><title>Introduction</title><p>Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are generally considered to be efficient alternatives to the traditional fee-for-service delivery system for providing health care. It is generally believed that HMO systems help to control the use of health care services&#x02014;especially the use of costly institutional services&#x02014; and hence can restrain costs. HMOs have increased substantially in the past decade. During the 1970s the number of HMOs in this country increased from 39 to 217; their enrollment increased from 3.6 million to 7.9 million (<xref rid=\"b4-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Falkson, 1980</xref>). This growth has largely been among employed persons through their health insurance plans at work. Enrollment rates of non-employed persons, including Medicare beneficiaries, have remained relatively low.</p><p>Congress has legislated changes in the Social Security Act to stimulate enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs. Section 1876 of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 authorizes two methods for reimbursing HMOs. The first method, based on cost, employs the usual Medicare cost principles for reimbursing providers. The alternative method allows HMOs to enter into a risk-sharing contract with Medicare. It places a restriction on the <italic>per capita</italic> amount Medicare may reimburse an HMO based upon the amount Medicare would have otherwise reimbursed physicians and other providers of Part A and Part B services in the fee-for-service sector. This method also provides for the sharing of &#x0201c;savings&#x0201d; if <italic>per capita</italic> costs in the HMO are below the expected fee-for-service costs. With this risk-sharing provision, the HMO retains one-half of savings above 80 percent of the equivalent fee-for-service costs, for a maximum of 10 percent. If <italic>per capita</italic> costs incurred by the HMO are greater, the resulting difference (losses) must be absorbed by the HMO but can be carried forward and offset from savings realized in later years.</p><p>As of March 1981, 40 HMOs were operating under the provisions of Section 1876. Thirty-nine had chosen cost contracts, and only one (Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound) was operating on a risk contract basis. To encourage risk contracts, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) initiated several demonstrations to enroll Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs under special risk mechanisms.<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1-hcfr-4-1-55\"><sup>1</sup></xref> These demonstrations are designed to test alternative risk reimbursement procedures to enroll significant numbers of Medicare beneficiaries through aggressive marketing techniques and attractive benefit packages.</p><p>Payment to an HMO under these demonstrations is based either on a percentage of the Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) or is &#x0201c;capped&#x0201d; at a percent of the AAPCC. The AAPCC is defined in the enabling legislation as the average <italic>per capita</italic> cost of providing services to the enrolled group of beneficiaries if the beneficiaries had been receiving services in the fee-for-service sector of the health care system. The legislation specifies that the average cost is to be adjusted to account for actuarial differences in risk between the enrolled Medicare group and the Medicare population in the same geographic area. The legislation lists age, sex, race, institutional status, disability status, and &#x0201c;any other relevant factors&#x0201d; as factors to be used in calculating the AAPCC. The calculation of the AAPCC as implemented by HCFA includes adjustments for age, sex, institutional status, and welfare status. Disability is accounted for by calculating separate AAPCC rates for aged and disabled beneficiary enrollment groups.<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn2-hcfr-4-1-55\"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>To the extent that the four factors of age, sex, institutional status, and welfare status alone do not control for major expenditure differences, the AAPCC payment could be high or low for a given enrollment group. Adverse selection (from the HMO\\'s point of view) would occur when the risk of incurring medical expenses by an enrollment group is greater than predicted by the AAPCC. Favorable selection would occur when the risk is less than predicted by the AAPCC. In the latter case, AAPCC based payments could be high relative to risk. Thus, what might appear to be a Medicare program cost savings actually represents increased Federal costs relative to expenditures that would have accrued in a fee-for-service setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This study focuses on the pre-enrollment experience of Medicare enrollees in three demonstration HMOs to determine if evidence exists of selection bias with respect to their Medicare enrollment. Medicare reimbursement rates for the HMO enrollees for a four year period prior to enrollment were compared with reimbursement rates over the same time period for a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries drawn from the HMO market area. The reimbursement rate comparisons were adjusted for differences in AAPCC factors between the HMO enrollee and comparison groups. In this sense, the study is also an evaluation of the efficiency of the AAPCC factors in accounting for differences in utilization and reimbursement. In other words, to the extent that differences in reimbursement rates exist after AAPCC adjustments are made, there is evidence of both selection bias and inefficiency in the AAPCC technique.</p><p>This methodology implicitly assumes that there is some consistency in the use of services over time and that post-enrollment &#x0201c;risk&#x0201d; is related to pre-enrollment experience. This assumption is the basis for the use by insurance companies of experience rating in setting premium levels. While use of health care services in one time period is not a perfect predictor of subsequent use, there is growing evidence that patterns of use tend to be consistent over time. This relationship is strongest for ambulatory care but exists for hospitalization as well (<xref rid=\"b14-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Roos and Shapiro, 1981</xref>; <xref rid=\"b13-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Mullooby and Freeborn, 1979</xref>; <xref rid=\"b11-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">McCall and Wai, 1981</xref>; Eggers, 1981).</p></sec><sec><title>Selection Bias</title><p><xref rid=\"b10-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Luft (1981)</xref> has studied and summarized the research on selection bias in HMOs. He identifies four hypotheses explaining the decision to join an HMO.</p><list list-type=\"order\"><list-item><p>The risk-vulnerability hypothesis&#x02014;This postulates that persons who anticipate large medical bills or feel that they are high risks for incurring large medical expenses will want to insure themselves against this risk by joining an HMO. This would result in adverse selection from the HMO\\'s perspective.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Attitudes toward illness and medical care&#x02014;This theory suggests that HMOs will be more attractive to persons who believe in preventive services and are more likely to use services in the early stages of illness. This could result in either adverse or favorable selection.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Worried well&#x02014;This hypothesis suggests that some persons make excessive demands on the health care system in relation to their need for care and that the extensive ambulatory coverage available in HMOs will attract such persons, resulting in adverse selection.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lack of integration&#x02014;A significant percentage of persons in the United States report not having a regular source of health care. Opportunity to enroll in an HMO provides these persons with access to the health care system. If their problem is lack of access, they may increase their use after enrollment. If their lack of a provider reflects a perception that they don\\'t need one, then the HMO may be getting a preferred risk group. People well integrated into the health care system should be less likely to join an HMO because they have a provider with whom they are familiar.</p></list-item></list><p>All four of these incentives to join HMOs are tempered by the basic inertia of human nature. People need a reason to change providers. All things being equal, most persons will stay with their current source of care.</p><p>Luft concludes, from a review of the research literature, that predicting the direction of selection bias depends on a number of factors. These are: 1) the HMO premium the enrollee must pay, 2) available options, and 3) the necessity of changing physicians. He says:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;All evidence points to the importance of the preexisting physician-patient relationship. People with strong ties are unwilling to break them and will prefer to retain their old coverage unless an HMO is structured to change only the financial linkages rather than the personal ties.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p>Several of these factors could have affected the decision of Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the demonstration HMOs. Each of the demonstration HMOs offers increased benefits to the enrollee. Two of the three (Fallon and Marshfield) require an extra premium above the normal Part B premium to cover these services. Although this premium substitutes for the expected Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts and is actually lower than the expected amount, it must be prepaid by the enrollee and is an expense whether or not he or she uses services. Also, in two of the three HMOs (Fallon and Kaiser) the enrollee is required to receive care only from the closed panel of physicians.</p><p>Two aspects of the Medicare program could also affect HMO enrollment. One is assignment, that is, whether or not physicians will accept the Medicare allowed fee as full payment. When physicians do not accept assignment, Medicare beneficiaries are subject to out-of-pocket costs above the usual 20 percent coinsurance required for Part B services. In areas with low rates of assignment, HMOs may appear more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries.<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn3-hcfr-4-1-55\"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>A second factor concerns Medigap insurance, those private plans which primarily cover the cost-sharing parts of Medicare. If these plans are reasonably priced in an HMO catchment area, Medicare beneficiaries may opt for Medigap coverage rather than joining the HMO. Although both assignment rates and Medigap insurance could affect HMO enrollment, it is not clear how these should affect selection bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Previous Work</title><p>One study examining the pre-enrollment experience of Medicare beneficiaries who enrolled in an HMO has been reported (<xref rid=\"b3-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Eggers, 1980</xref>). The Group Health Cooperative (GHC) of Puget Sound, Washington contracted with HCFA to enroll Medicare beneficiaries and accept payment on a risk basis under the provisions of Section 1876. Examination of pre-HMO enrollment reimbursement and utilization data showed that Medicare beneficiaries who joined the HMO had inpatient hospital days of care rates that were 50 percent lower and inpatient reimbursement rates that were over 40 percent lower than those for other Medicare beneficiaries living in the same geographic area. Thus, the only previous evaluation of an HMO Medicare demonstration project produced strong evidence of a favorable (to the HMO) selection process.</p><p>Three limitations in the GHC study affected its generalizability. First, it was a single case study of enrollment experience in one HMO. Second, because there were no Part B reimbursement data available, a proxy for Part B, the percent of persons meeting the deductible, had to be used instead. It was possible, therefore, that Part B reimbursements per user among the HMO enrollees were sufficiently high to partially offset the observed differences in Part A reimbursements. Third, the comparison group included persons who died during the study period, whereas all the HMO enrollees obviously had to have survived the pre-enrollment period. A factor reflecting the heavy use of services in the last year of life was used to adjust the comparison group rates, but this was only an approximation technique.<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn4-hcfr-4-1-55\"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>The current study is primarily a replication of the GHC study in three additional HMO areas. However, improvements in methodology have been made over the original study. First, we have included both Part A and Part B Medicare reimbursement records, thus enabling the study to examine differential Part A and Part B patterns of care. Second, we studied three HMOs\\' experiences here, thus greatly enhancing the generalizability of the findings. Third, each of these HMOs enrolled over 5,000 Medicare beneficiaries in contrast to the GHC enrollment of 1,000 at the time of the previous study. The rates, therefore, have more stability. Finally, the comparison group is composed entirely of persons who were survivors of the pre-enrollment time period, so there is no need to adjust for differences in reimbursement for persons who died during the study period.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"methods\"><title>Methodology</title><sec><title>Site Selection</title><p>Under the HMO demonstration program, a number of HMOs agreed to enroll Medicare beneficiaries on a risk basis.

It is sponsored by the Marshfield Clinic (a 160 physician, multi-specialty group practice), St. Joseph\\'s Hospital, Blue Cross of Wisconsin, and Surgical Care Blue Shield. The plan serves over 55,000 residents in rural Wisconsin, incorporating all or parts of seven counties. Like Fallon and Kaiser, the plan is a group practice HMO with salaried physicians. However, the fact that it includes the major providers in the area gives it the character or appearance of an individual practice association (IPA) HMO. An IPA HMO contracts with most or all physicians in an area to provide services, usually on a fee-for-service basis. The physicians retain their private offices, thus further distinguishing the IPA from the group model, where services are usually centralized at a clinic. Marshfield is also unusual in that it maintains a large fee-for-service clientele and the physicians are often unaware of which patients are HMO members and which patients are fee-for-service.</p><p>In the first contract year, HCFA capitation to Marshfield was set at 99 percent of the Area Prevailing Cost.

All beneficiaries who had enrolled in the three HMOs as of April 1981 were initially selected for inclusion. Of these, 2,100 persons had had some previous HMO and/or GPPP experience. (Most were already members of Kaiser whose membership was changed to the risk contract.) These persons were removed from the analysis because their pre-enrollment experience would not represent reimbursement in a non-HMO setting. This left 19,518 persons for whom enrollment in one of the three demonstrations represented their first HMO experience. Disability beneficiaries (N = 550) were excluded because there were too few for a separate analysis. Forty persons had end-stage renal disease and were not included. Finally, there were 840 beneficiaries who were not residents of the counties for which data were collected.<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn9-hcfr-4-1-55\"><sup>9</sup></xref> As a result, 18,088 HMO enrollees were included in the study. Of the persons without previous HMO experience, the study population represents 93 percent of the total at-risk enrollment in these HMOs.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"other\"><title>Comparison Group</title><p>Due to the large total Medicare enrollment in the service areas of the HMOs (nearly 250,000 persons) and the problems in manipulating such a large file, a 5 percent sample (based on the terminal digits of the Health Insurance Claim number) of people living in the HMO catchment areas and not subsequently enrolling in the HMO was selected for the comparison group. As with the HMO sample, persons with previous GPPP or HMO experience, disability beneficiaries, those with end-stage renal disease, and persons not residents of the target counties were removed from the study. In total, 15,381 people were included in the comparison group.</p><p>Both the HMO enrollee and comparison groups were composed of aged Medicare beneficiaries, living in the same geographic area, who were alive in 1980. Therefore, for the years under examination (1976 through 1979), all persons were survivors. Because people use many more services in their last year of life than surviving Medicare beneficiaries, any bias for this phenomenon has been removed by including only survivors in the enrollee and comparison groups.<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn10-hcfr-4-1-55\"><sup>10</sup></xref></p></sec><sec sec-type=\"other\"><title>Data</title><p>We derived utilization and reimbursement data from the Medicare Statistical System (MSS). The MSS includes all billing claims for which Medicare reimburses. We developed a special file for the HMO demonstration projects, one which includes 100 percent of the Part A and Part B bills<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn11-hcfr-4-1-55\"><sup>11</sup></xref> for residents of designated counties in the United States. The bills were compiled by residence of the beneficiary so that any use outside of the county is included. The file includes all Medicare bills incurred during calendar years 1976 through 1979 for residents of these counties. Because all bills include the unique beneficiary claim number, it was possible to link all bills with each individual in the HMO and comparison groups. Some enrollees and members of the comparison group undoubtedly moved during the 1976 to 1979 period; this change of address could affect the reimbursement rates.</p><p>If a person was eligible to receive services in 1976, for example, but did not live in one of these counties, his or her reimbursements would have been missed, thus biasing the reimbursement rates downward. This potential migration bias is discussed in the following section.</p><p>The Continuous Medicare History Sample (CMHS) is a 5 percent longitudinal sample of Medicare beneficiaries which includes people\\'s addresses by year. It was therefore possible to link beneficiaries in the study (all of the comparison group because it was also a 5 percent sample and 5 percent of the HMO enrollees) with CMHS residence data to check for migration bias. <xref rid=\"t1-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 1</xref> shows the results of this analysis. In the Fallon area, of those HMO enrollees living in the county in 1980 who were Medicare eligibles in 1976, 97.1 percent lived in the county in 1976. The figure for the comparison group was 95.1 percent. Thus, it appears that the comparison group rates are biased downward to a slightly greater extent than are the HMO enrollee rates. The percent of people living in the Kaiser area counties in 1976 was almost identical for the HMO enrollee and comparison groups (89.9 percent and 89.6 percent, respectively). Both groups were, therefore, biased downward to the same extent. In the Marshfield area, a higher percent of HMO enrollees 95.9 percent) lived in the counties in 1976 than did comparison group beneficiaries (90.3 percent). Comparison group rates in Marshfield are biased downward to a greater extent than HMO enrollee rates.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"other\"><title>Use of Person-Years</title><p>The analysis consisted primarily of comparisons of rates of reimbursement between the HMO and comparison groups. It was important, therefore, not to include in the at-risk population persons who were not eligible to receive benefits at the time reimbursements were counted. For instance, a person age 67 in 1980 was not at risk of incurring Medicare reimbursements in 1976.<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn12-hcfr-4-1-55\"><sup>12</sup></xref> To accurately relate reimbursements to eligibility, we calculated months of eligibility for each individual for each of the years 1976 through 1979. This was done by counting eligibility from the time of entitlement. (Part A and Part B months of entitlement were calculated separately.) Entitlement dates were available from the Medicare master beneficiary record. We then used total person years of eligibility to calculate rates of reimbursement for each age/sex group within each HMO area. <xref rid=\"t2-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 2</xref> shows the number of persons and the total person years of Medicare Part A eligibility for the HMO comparison groups for the Fallon, Marshfield, and Kaiser areas. In the Fallon area, the 5,365 HMO enrollees accounted for 3,288 person years of Medicare Part A eligibility in 1976. The 4,090 persons in the comparison group accounted for 2,999 eligibility person years in 1976. Person years increased substantially each year as more persons reached 65 and became entitled.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"other\"><title>Adjustments for AAPCC Factors</title><p>The comparison group reimbursement rates in each HMO area serve as the basis for computing expected rates for the HMO enrollees, since the procedure produced a comparison group similar to the enrollees in terms of survival and residency. We used AAPCC underwriting factors to produce expected rates for the HMO enrollees. The Office of Financial and Actuarial Analysis provided the most recent age, sex, institutional status, and Medicare welfare status distributions for the total population in the three HMO areas and for the beneficiaries who enrolled in the HMOs. We took the age and sex of Medicare beneficiaries directly from the Master Beneficiary Records maintained by HCFA. We determined welfare status on the basis of whether Medicaid pays for (or &#x0201c;buys in&#x0201d;) the Part B premium for Medicare beneficiaries. This information also was available from the Master Beneficiary Records. Institutional status is not routinely collected or maintained as part of the Medicare Statistical System. Therefore, these data had to be collected through surveys of long-term care facilities (<xref rid=\"b17-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Trieger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>).

In effect, this results in a reimbursement rate for individuals in the comparison group as if they had the same county distribution as the HMO enrollees.</p><p>It is possible that HMOs could enroll beneficiaries from parts of counties that either have higher or lower reimbursement rates than the county as a whole. If so, the comparison group would not be exactly matched to the enrollee group. However, reimbursement under the AAPCC formula is based on the total county experience. Therefore, to be consistent with Medicare AAPCC reimbursement policy, we did not adjust for intra-county variation in reimbursement patterns.</p><sec sec-type=\"other\"><title>Analysis</title><p>The analyses consist of year-by-year comparisons of the average reimbursements per HMO enrollee with those of the comparison group with the AAPCC adjustment.

Seventy percent of the HMO enrollees were age 65 to 74 as compared to 56 percent of the comparison group. Males accounted for 47 percent of the HMO group and 43 percent of the comparison group. In addition, 8 percent of the comparison group and only 1 percent of the HMO group were Medicaid recipients. Thus, the HMO group is heavily weighted with persons who have lower expected rates of reimbursements.</p><p>In summary, the data in <xref rid=\"t3-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 3</xref> illustrate the need to adjust the observed reimbursements in the analysis.

Because the Fallon enrollees were drawn almost entirely from Worcester County, Massachusetts, the comparison group was also limited to residents of Worcester. In the Kaiser area, there were small differences in county of residence between the two groups. A slightly higher percentage of HMO enrollees were residents of Multnomah County than the comparison group (64 percent and 58 percent, respectively).</p><p>There was a bigger difference in county of residence within the Marshfield area. Over one-half of the people in the comparison group were residents of Marathon County, whereas only one-fifth of the HMO enrollees lived in that county. Two-thirds of the HMO group were residents of Clark and Wood Counties. These counties accounted for 41 percent of the comparison group. In both the Kaiser and Marshfield areas, the comparison group, being a random sample of beneficiaries, tended to more closely approximate the county distribution of all Medicare beneficiaries than did the HMO enrollees.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Reimbursement Rates</title><p><xref rid=\"t5-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"table\">Tables 5</xref>, <xref rid=\"t6-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"table\">6</xref>, and <xref rid=\"t7-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"table\">7</xref> present the reimbursement comparisons for Fallon, Kaiser, and Marshfield, respectively.

In two of the years, the difference was statistically significant at the .05 confidence level. The four year average difference was also statistically significant.</p><p>Although the differences were not as great as with inpatient reimbursements, the HMO enrollees in the Fallon area had lower Part B reimbursements than the adjusted comparison group. The HMO enrollee rate was $111 in 1976 and increased each year, up to $206 in 1979. The 1976 and 1979 adjusted rates for the comparison group were $121 and $244, respectively. The difference in rates between the two groups ranged from 8 percent to 18 percent during the four years. The four year average difference in rates was 13 percent ($160 for the HMO enrollee group and $183 for the comparison group). In 1978, 1979, and for the four year average, the differences were statistically significant.</p><p>Total reimbursements (which include skilled nursing facility and home health agency reimbursements as well as hospital inpatient, physician, and outpatient reimbursements) tended to reflect Part A patterns more closely than Part B, because Part A reimbursements per person are more than twice as great as Part B reimbursements. Over the four year period under consideration, total reimbursements per HMO enrollee ranged from 16 percent to 29 percent below the adjusted reimbursement rate for the comparison group. The four year average difference was 21 percent ($497 for the HMO enrollees and $625 for the comparison group).

The four year average total reimbursement rate for the HMO enrollees was $436, which was 21 percent below the adjusted total reimbursement rate of the comparison group ($554).

Differences between the two groups in hospital inpatient reimbursement rates were smaller in Marshfield than in the other two areas. In 1978, the reimbursement rate for the HMO enrollees was 8 percent higher than the corresponding adjusted rate for the comparison group. In the three other years, the HMO enrollee rates ranged from 7 to 15 percent below the adjusted comparison group rates. Over all four years, the HMO enrollee rate was only 4 percent below that of the comparison group. In none of the four years, nor in the four year average, were the AAPCC adjusted differences statistically significant.</p><p>With regard to physician and outpatient reimbursements, the HMO enrollees were heavier users than the comparison group (with adjustment). HMO enrollees\\' reimbursement rates ranged from 11 percent higher in 1979 to 34 percent higher in 1978 (statistically significant) than the comparison group. Over all four years, the HMO enrollee rate of $159 was 22 percent higher than the comparison group adjusted rate of $131. It was also statistically significant.</p><p>Naturally, the higher inpatient reimbursements for the comparison group and the higher physician and outpatient reimbursements for the HMO enrollees tended to offset each other in the total reimbursement rates. In two of the years (1976 and 1979), the adjusted total reimbursements for the comparison group are higher; in the other two years (1977 and 1978), the HMO enrollee rates are higher. As a result, the four year average shows the HMO enrollee total reimbursements of $403 per person to be 4 percent greater than the AAPCC adjusted reimbursement rate of $388 for the comparison group. None of the total reimbursement differences were statistically significant.</p><p>The Marshfield results are similar to a previous study of self-selection at Marshfield (<xref rid=\"b2-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Broida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1975</xref>). In that study of enrolled persons under age 65, pre-enrollment ambulatory use was higher than that of a comparable group using fee-for-service medical care. There was little difference in the use of hospital care.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type=\"discussion\"><title>Discussion</title><p>Two conclusions can be drawn from the reimbursement analyses. First, in each of the three HMO areas HMO enrollee reimbursement rates were lower than unadjusted reimbursement rates for the comparison groups. Because the enrollees tended to be younger and less likely to be on welfare, this was to be expected. The AAPCC formula, by controlling for these factors, should have reduced the differences between the groups. Before AAPCC adjustment, the HMO enrollee total reimbursement rates in Fallon and Kaiser were 31 percent and 29 percent lower than their respective comparison groups. With AAPCC adjustment, these differences were reduced to 21 percent, a 32 percent reduction in Fallon and a 28 percent reduction in Kaiser. In Marshfield, the AAPCC adjustment resulted in the HMO total reimbursement rates changing from 14 percent below the comparison group rate to 4 percent above the comparison group rate. Thus the AAPCC is at least partially successful in determining an appropriate reimbursement rate for HMOs.</p><p>Second, despite the use of an AAPCC adjustment to the data, significant differences between HMO enrollee and comparison groups remain in two of the three HMOs. Under the assumption that pre-enrollment experience is predictive of future experience, apparently there are selection factors for which AAPCC does not control which can affect enrollment in HMOs and subsequent financial experience.</p><sec><title>Age/Sex Adjustment</title><p>The possibility also exists that one or more AAPCC factors are inappropriate adjustors and that a better adjustment mechanism can be developed. It was not the purpose of this study to develop new actuarial adjustment procedures. Nevertheless, simpler methods of adjusting rate data do exist. A typical method of adjusting health related data is direct age/sex standardization. It is of interest, therefore, to perform an age/sex standardization and compare the results to the AAPCC adjustment.</p><p><xref rid=\"t8-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 8</xref> shows 1976 to 1979 average reimbursement rates broken into age/sex categories. In Fallon, the unadjusted percent difference between the two groups is &#x02013; 31 percent. In nine of the ten age/sex cells, the HMO enrollees had lower reimbursement rates. In the tenth cell (males age 80-84), the HMO group was 1 percent higher. In six of the cells, the difference was greater than 30 percent.</p><p>In Kaiser, the total unadjusted difference was &#x02013; 29 percent, and in all ten age/sex cells the HMO enrollees had lower reimbursement rates. In six of the cells the difference was greater than 30 percent.</p><p>In Marshfield, the total unadjusted difference was &#x02013; 14 percent. The comparison group in Marshfield is smaller than in the other areas which leads to greater variation between cells. In seven of the cells, the comparison group had higher reimbursement rates, while in three cells the HMO enrollees had the higher rates. These variations are probably due to both a) the small difference in total reimbursements for the groups as a whole and b) the relatively small number of persons in the individual cells for the comparison group.</p><p><xref rid=\"t9-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 9</xref> shows the age/sex adjusted total reimbursement rates and the AAPCC adjusted rates. In each HMO area the age/sex adjustment reduces the difference between the two groups, but not as much as the AAPCC adjustment does.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=\"conclusions\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The intent of this study was to determine whether an adverse or favorable selection process existed among Medicare beneficiaries enrolling in each of three HMOs contracting with HCFA to provide services to beneficiaries. This was done by comparing the pre-enrollment reimbursement experience of Medicare beneficiaries who enrolled in HMOs with a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the same geographic area. Because reimbursement to an HMO is based on the AAPCC for the area in which the HMO is located, we applied AAPCC adjustments to the rates to control for differences in age, sex, welfare status, and institutional status.</p><p>In two of the three HMO areas, Fallon and Kaiser, pre-enrollment rates for the HMO enrollees were significantly lower than the reimbursement rates among the comparison group beneficiaries, both before and after adjustment for AAPCC factors. This indicates a selection process which favors the HMO. The differential was greatest for inpatient services but existed for outpatient and physician services as well. Therefore, the argument that people who choose HMOs are predisposed toward higher use of ambulatory services in lieu of inpatient services is not supported for the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in these HMOs. The pre-enrollment experience for Fallon and Kaiser is similar to that reported earlier for Group Health Cooperative (<xref rid=\"b3-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Eggers, 1980</xref>).</p><p>The Marshfield experience was different. For this HMO, after adjusting for AAPCC factors, there was no statistically significant difference between the HMO and comparison groups in total reimbursements. While the HMO enrollees had lower inpatient reimbursement rates, these were offset by a higher use of ambulatory services (outpatient and physician services).</p><p>The results of this study have implications both for Medicare payments under prepayment mechanisms and for the selection issue in general. First, HCFA created the AAPCC methodology to adjust HMO payments to account for variations in enrollment mix by age, sex, welfare status, and institutional status and to take into account regional variation in health care costs. A major concern has been the extent to which unmeasured beneficiary characteristics that affect utilization and reimbursement are present in people who enroll in HMOs. The results in Fallon and Kaiser (as well as GHC) suggest that important decisions can exist among the enrollee population which the present AAPCC adjustment mechanism cannot correct. This is not to say that the AAPCC factors are inappropriate or inaccurate for calculating reimbursement amounts. As this study shows, the AAPCC mechanism accounted for part of the variation in pre-enrollment reimbursement rates. Moreover, compared with a traditional age/sex adjustment, the AAPCC reduced reimbursement differences to a greater extent. Yet this study seems to indicate that the present AAPCC factors are not sufficient.</p><p>HCFA is currently evaluating the AAPCC mechanism. The AAPCC calculation involves yearly surveys of the institutionalized population in each HMO area. This procedure is expensive, time consuming, and subject to severe under-reporting (<xref rid=\"b17-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Trieger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>).</p><p>The second implication of the study relates to the selection bias issue. Although it is not possible to rule out enrollment measures designed to select healthier beneficiaries for the HMOs, there are reasons to believe that such selection did not take place. First, all three HMOs enrolled thousands of people over a relatively short period of time. This alone suggests a fair open enrollment process. Second, the demonstrations were closely monitored to assure a fair enrollment process. Third, it is not easy to determine risk, even if the HMOs were intent on doing so. Finally, Marshfield\\'s failure to experience favorable selection is further evidence that the HMOs were not actively encouraging it.</p><p>Assuming that the selection bias was on the part of the enrollees, there is reason to suspect that, in Luft\\'s terms, integration into the health system may be a determining factor. The major factor differentiating Marshfield from the Kaiser and Fallon HMOs (and GHC) is that Marshfield operates much like an IPA, whereas the other three are closed panel HMOs. People enrolling in Fallon, Kaiser, or GHC probably had to give up their previous sources of care. Because Marshfield is essentially the only significant provider of care in its area, most enrollees probably already were receiving care from a Marshfield physician and therefore did not have to change physicians. Fallon and Kaiser may have enrolled more persons who did not have a personal physician or a strong attachment to their previous physician.</p><p>If lack of integration is a key factor in determining enrollment in HMOs for the Medicare population, it could have two consequences. First, it might be that the study HMOs enrolled persons who simply had a lower need for care. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics show that the primary reason given for not having a physician is that the person doesn\\'t perceive a need for one (<xref rid=\"b1-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Blumberg, 1978</xref>). In this case, the HMO would be achieving favorable selection.</p><p>Alternatively, the low reimbursement rates and possible lack of integration prior to enrollment could indicate unmet need and underservice among these populations. If so, the HMOs may be increasing access to care for these persons by enrolling them, and the cost of providing services to a population without previous access to care might increase. The question of whether low pre-enrollment use rates represent less need for care or less access to care cannot be determined simply by examining pre-enrollment patterns. What happens to these patients after enrollment is equally important. Continued low use rates would support the favorable selection process hypothesis. If use rates rise and remain high, lack of access would appear to be a determinant of low pre-enrollment rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Technical Note: Calculation of AAPCC Adjustment</title><p>In the reimbursement formula for HMOs under risk, the ratio of the underwriting index for the enrolled group to the underwriting index for the county population is used to adjust the county <italic>per capita</italic> cost to reflect the characteristics of the HMO enrollees.</p><p><xref rid=\"fd3-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"disp-formula\">Equation 1</xref> represents the AAPCC formula:</p><disp-formula id=\"fd3-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id=\"m3\"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>AAPCC</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>USPCC</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>APCC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Co.</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>APCC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>U.S.</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mtext>&#x02211;</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>U</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i HMO</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy=\"true\">/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mtext>&#x02211;</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i HMO</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mtext>&#x02211;</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>U</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i Co.</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy=\"true\">/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mtext>&#x02211;</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i Co.</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><list list-type=\"simple\"><list-item><p>where: AAPCC = adjusted average <italic>per capita</italic> cost</p></list-item><list-item><p>USPCC = U.S. average <italic>per capita</italic> cost to the Medicare program</p></list-item><list-item><p>\\n<inline-formula><mml:math id=\"m4\"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>AAPC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Co.</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>AAPCC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>U.S.</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> = ratio of <italic>per capita</italic> reimbursement in the county to the U.S. (five year average)</p></list-item><list-item><p>and: U<sub>i</sub> = a unique underwriting index which represents the ratio of risk for a particular subset of the Medicare population to the national average.

Results indicated that HMO enrollee reimbursement rates were more than 50 percent lower than this comparison group of survivors for each of the four years (1974 to 1977) prior to enrollment.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn5-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>5</label><p>The discussions of the three plans included in this study were taken from <xref rid=\"b17-hcfr-4-1-55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Trieger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn6-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>6</label><p>The ACR calculation is derived by adjusting the HMO\\'s utilization and cost statistics in its private pay market to reflect the characteristics of the Medicare population.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn7-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>7</label><p>This is simply the average Medicare reimbursement per beneficiary for that area.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn8-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>8</label><p>Section 1833 was written into the original Medicare legislation to enable group practice prepayment plans (GPPPs) to participate in Medicare with minimal constraints. GPPPs are paid for Part B services based on the portion of audited costs allocated to Medicare members. Other services covered by Medicare are billed on a charge-related-cost basis, through the routine Medicare billing procedures (that is, through carriers and intermediaries).</p></fn><fn id=\"fn9-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>9</label><p>The following counties were included in the analysis: Fallon&#x02014;Worcester; Marshfield&#x02014;Clark, Marathon, Taylor, and Wood; Kaiser&#x02014;Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties in Oregon and Clark County in Washington.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn10-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>10</label><p>For discussions of reimbursement patterns in the last year of life, see Lubitz, J. <italic>et al.</italic>, &#x0201c;Use and Costs of Medicare Services in the Last Year of Life,&#x0201d; Internal Working Paper, HCFA, ORDS, August, 1981 and Gornick, M., &#x0201c;Ten Years of Medicare: Impact on the Covered Population,&#x0201d; <italic>Social Security Bulletin</italic>, July 1976.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn11-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>11</label><p>Medicare reimbursable services are billed by type of service. The file includes all bills for inpatient, outpatient, physician, home health, and skilled nursing facility services.

These include dental care, outpatient drugs, eyeglasses, and nursing home care.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn12-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>12</label><p>This is not true, of course, if that person was a disability beneficiary prior to age 65.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn13-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>13</label><p>We adjusted the AAPCC for the comparison group by using the composition of the total population and applying it to the average reimbursement of the 5 percent sample comparison group used in the study.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn14-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>14</label><p>Outpatient reimbursements include not only outpatient departments but other sources such as community health centers, rural health clinics, and limited care facilities.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn15-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>15</label><p>Technically, the HMO enrollees represent the universe of Medicare enrollees in each HMO, and their rates are not sample estimates but population parameters. However, by treating them as samples with variances in rates, it becomes more difficult to detect selection bias and thus represents a conservative approach for testing for the significance of an observed difference.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn16-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>16</label><p>For a discussion of this, see Kish, Leslie, <italic>Survey Sampling</italic>, John Wiley and Sons, 1965, pp. 457.</p></fn><fn id=\"fn17-hcfr-4-1-55\"><label>17</label><p>Average reimbursements per enrollee are higher for whites than for other races, although the difference is decreasing.

maintenance organizations (HMOs) are generally considered to be efficient alternatives to the traditional fee-for-service delivery system for providing health care. It is generally believed that HMO systems help to control the use of health care services—especially the use of costly institutional services— and hence can restrain costs. HMOs have increased substantially in the past decade. During the 1970s the number of HMOs in this country increased from 39 to 217; their enrollment increased from 3.6 million to 7.9 million (Falkson, 1980). This growth has largely been among employed persons through their health insurance plans at work. Enrollment rates of non-employed persons, including Medicare beneficiaries, have remained relatively low.\\n\\nCongress has legislated changes in the Social Security Act to stimulate enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs. Section 1876 of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 authorizes two methods for reimbursing HMOs. The first method, based on cost, employs the usual Medicare cost principles for reimbursing providers. The alternative method allows HMOs to enter into a risk-sharing contract with Medicare. It places a restriction on the per capita amount Medicare may reimburse an HMO based upon the amount Medicare would have otherwise reimbursed physicians and other providers of Part A and Part B services in the fee-for-service sector. This method also provides for the sharing of “savings” if per capita costs in the HMO are below the expected fee-for-service costs. With this risk-sharing provision, the HMO retains one-half of savings above 80 percent of the equivalent fee-for-service costs, for a maximum of 10 percent. If per capita costs incurred by the HMO are greater, the resulting difference (losses) must be absorbed by the HMO but can be carried forward and offset from savings realized in later years.\\n\\nAs of March 1981, 40 HMOs were operating under the provisions of Section 1876. Thirty-nine had chosen cost contracts, and only one (Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound) was operating on a risk contract basis. To encourage risk contracts, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) initiated several demonstrations to enroll Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs under special risk mechanisms.1 These demonstrations are designed to test alternative risk reimbursement procedures to enroll significant numbers of Medicare beneficiaries through aggressive marketing techniques and attractive benefit packages.\\n\\nPayment to an HMO under these demonstrations is based either on a percentage of the Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) or is “capped” at a percent of the AAPCC. The AAPCC is defined in the enabling legislation as the average per capita cost of providing services to the enrolled group of beneficiaries if the beneficiaries had been receiving services in the fee-for-service sector of the health care system. The legislation specifies that the average cost is to be adjusted to account for actuarial differences in risk between the enrolled Medicare group and the Medicare population in the same geographic area. The legislation lists age, sex, race, institutional status, disability status, and “any other relevant factors” as factors to be used in calculating the AAPCC. The calculation of the AAPCC as implemented by HCFA includes adjustments for age, sex, institutional status, and welfare status. Disability is accounted for by calculating separate AAPCC rates for aged and disabled beneficiary enrollment groups.2\\n\\nTo the extent that the four factors of age, sex, institutional status, and welfare status alone do not control for major expenditure differences, the AAPCC payment could be high or low for a given enrollment group. Adverse selection (from the HMO's point of view) would occur when the risk of incurring medical expenses by an enrollment group is greater than predicted by the AAPCC. Favorable selection would occur when the risk is less than predicted by the AAPCC. In the latter case, AAPCC based payments could be high relative to risk. Thus, what might appear to be a Medicare program cost savings actually represents increased Federal costs relative to expenditures that would have accrued in a fee-for-service setting.\\n\\n\\nObjectives\\n\\nThis study focuses on the pre-enrollment experience of Medicare enrollees in three demonstration HMOs to determine if evidence exists of selection bias with respect to their Medicare enrollment. Medicare reimbursement rates for the HMO enrollees for a four year period prior to enrollment were compared with reimbursement rates over the same time period for a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries drawn from the HMO market area. The reimbursement rate comparisons were adjusted for differences in AAPCC factors between the HMO enrollee and comparison groups. In this sense, the study is also an evaluation of the efficiency of the AAPCC factors in accounting for differences in utilization and reimbursement. In other words, to the extent that differences in reimbursement rates exist after AAPCC adjustments are made, there is evidence of both selection bias and inefficiency in the AAPCC technique.\\n\\nThis methodology implicitly assumes that there is some consistency in the use of services over time and that post-enrollment “risk” is related to pre-enrollment experience. This assumption is the basis for the use by insurance companies of experience rating in setting premium levels. While use of health care services in one time period is not a perfect predictor of subsequent use, there is growing evidence that patterns of use tend to be consistent over time. This relationship is strongest for ambulatory care but exists for hospitalization as well (Roos and Shapiro, 1981; Mullooby and Freeborn, 1979; McCall and Wai, 1981; Eggers, 1981).\\n\\n\\nSelection Bias\\n\\n\\nLuft (1981) has studied and summarized the research on selection bias in HMOs. He identifies four hypotheses explaining the decision to join an HMO.\\n\\nThe risk-vulnerability hypothesis—This postulates that persons who anticipate large medical bills or feel that they are high risks for incurring large medical expenses will want to insure themselves against this risk by joining an HMO. This would result in adverse selection from the HMO's perspective.\\n\\nAttitudes toward illness and medical care—This theory suggests that HMOs will be more attractive to persons who believe in preventive services and are more likely to use services in the early stages of illness. This could result in either adverse or favorable selection.\\n\\nWorried well—This hypothesis suggests that some persons make excessive demands on the health care system in relation to their need for care and that the extensive ambulatory coverage available in HMOs will attract such persons, resulting in adverse selection.\\n\\nLack of integration—A significant percentage of persons in the United States report not having a regular source of health care. Opportunity to enroll in an HMO provides these persons with access to the health care system. If their problem is lack of access, they may increase their use after enrollment. If their lack of a provider reflects a perception that they don't need one, then the HMO may be getting a preferred risk group. People well integrated into the health care system should be less likely to join an HMO because they have a provider with whom they are familiar.\\n\\nAll four of these incentives to join HMOs are tempered by the basic inertia of human nature. People need a reason to change providers. All things being equal, most persons will stay with their current source of care.\\n\\nLuft concludes, from a review of the research literature, that predicting the direction of selection bias depends on a number of factors. These are: 1) the HMO premium the enrollee must pay, 2) available options, and 3) the necessity of changing physicians. He says:\\n\\n“All evidence points to the importance of the preexisting physician-patient relationship. People with strong ties are unwilling to break them and will prefer to retain their old coverage unless an HMO is structured to change only the financial linkages rather than the personal ties.”\\n\\nSeveral of these factors could have affected the decision of Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the demonstration HMOs. Each of the demonstration HMOs offers increased benefits to the enrollee. Two of the three (Fallon and Marshfield) require an extra premium above the normal Part B premium to cover these services. Although this premium substitutes for the expected Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts and is actually lower than the expected amount, it must be prepaid by the enrollee and is an expense whether or not he or she uses services. Also, in two of the three HMOs (Fallon and Kaiser) the enrollee is required to receive care only from the closed panel of physicians.\\n\\nTwo aspects of the Medicare program could also affect HMO enrollment. One is assignment, that is, whether or not physicians will accept the Medicare allowed fee as full payment. When physicians do not accept assignment, Medicare beneficiaries are subject to out-of-pocket costs above the usual 20 percent coinsurance required for Part B services. In areas with low rates of assignment, HMOs may appear more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries.3\\n\\nA second factor concerns Medigap insurance, those private plans which primarily cover the cost-sharing parts of Medicare. If these plans are reasonably priced in an HMO catchment area, Medicare beneficiaries may opt for Medigap coverage rather than joining the HMO. Although both assignment rates and Medigap insurance could affect HMO enrollment, it is not clear how these should affect selection bias.\\n\\n\\nPrevious Work\\n\\nOne study examining the pre-enrollment experience of Medicare beneficiaries who enrolled in an HMO has been reported (Eggers, 1980). The Group Health Cooperative (GHC) of Puget Sound, Washington contracted with HCFA to enroll Medicare beneficiaries and accept payment on a risk basis under the provisions of Section 1876. Examination of pre-HMO enrollment reimbursement and utilization data showed that Medicare beneficiaries who joined the HMO had inpatient hospital days of care rates that were 50 percent lower and inpatient reimbursement rates that were over 40 percent lower than those for other Medicare beneficiaries living in the same geographic area. Thus, the only previous evaluation of an HMO Medicare demonstration project produced strong evidence of a favorable (to the HMO) selection process.\\n\\nThree limitations in the GHC study affected its generalizability. First, it was a single case study of enrollment experience in one HMO. Second, because there were no Part B reimbursement data available, a proxy for Part B, the percent of persons meeting the deductible, had to be used instead. It was possible, therefore, that Part B reimbursements per user among the HMO enrollees were sufficiently high to partially offset the observed differences in Part A reimbursements. Third, the comparison group included persons who died during the study period, whereas all the HMO enrollees obviously had to have survived the pre-enrollment period. A factor reflecting the heavy use of services in the last year of life was used to adjust the comparison group rates, but this was only an approximation technique.4\\n\\nThe current study is primarily a replication of the GHC study in three additional HMO areas. However, improvements in methodology have been made over the original study. First, we have included both Part A and Part B Medicare reimbursement records, thus enabling the study to examine differential Part A and Part B patterns of care. Second, we studied three HMOs' experiences here, thus greatly enhancing the generalizability of the findings. Third, each of these HMOs enrolled over 5,000 Medicare beneficiaries in contrast to the GHC enrollment of 1,000 at the time of the previous study. The rates, therefore, have more stability. Finally, the comparison group is composed entirely of persons who were survivors of the pre-enrollment time period, so there is no need to adjust for differences in reimbursement for persons who died during the study period.\\n\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\n\\nSite Selection\\n\\nUnder the HMO demonstration program, a number of HMOs agreed to enroll Medicare beneficiaries on a risk basis. At the time of this study, three HMO demonstrations had proceeded far enough to be included in the study.5\\n\\n\\nFallon\\n\\nThe Fallon Community Health Plan is a Federally qualified HMO jointly sponsored by the Fallon Clinic and Blue Cross of Massachusetts. Fallon is a one-group staff model HMO employing over 60 salaried staff physicians. By September 1980, it had enrolled 30,000 members in the Worcester County, Massachusetts area. As of April 1981, the plan had enrolled over 5,300 Medicare beneficiaries under the demonstration project.\\n\\nFallon's rates are based on an adjusted community rate (ACR)6 which is limited to 95 percent of the AAPCC. In the first year of the demonstration, Fallon's ACR was 91.4 percent of the Area Prevailing Cost (APC) for Medicare beneficiaries.7 An AAPCC could not be calculated due to unavailability of data on age, sex, welfare status, and institutional status of the enrollees. In the second year, Fallon was reimbursed at 95 percent of the AAPCC. The benefit package includes reduced deductibles and coinsurance, as well as certain services not included in regular Medicare coverage: preventive services, eye exams and one pair of eye glasses, prescriptions with a small copayment, and unlimited hospital days.\\n\\n\\nKaiser\\n\\nKaiser-Permanente of Oregon is a multi-specialty group staff model (physicians are salaried) HMO serving the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area. Its total enrollment exceeds 220,000 persons. It has a GPPP contract8 with Medicare to provide Part B services to 15,000 Medicare beneficiaries. By April of 1981, the plan had enrolled over 5,500 Medicare beneficiaries under the demonstration HMO project (excluding those who converted from their GPPP contracts). Kaiser's reimbursement is set at 95 percent of the AAPCC.\\n\\nThe basic Medicare package offered under the demonstration (the M-Plan, no premium) includes Medicare benefits without deductibles or coinsurance, routine physicals and eye exams, immunizations, full coverage for prescribed home health care, and non-psychiatric, out-patient mental health services. A random group of enrollees was offered the M-Plan or a choice of the M-Plan plus three benefit options: 1) eyeglasses, hearing aids, and drugs (with copayments) for a $6.00 monthly premium, 2) dental care and dentures for a $9.81 monthly premium, or 3) eyeglasses, hearing aids, drugs, dental care, and dentures for a $15.81 monthly premium.\\n\\n\\nMarshfield\\n\\nThe Greater Marshfield Community Health Plan in Marshfield, Wisconsin was established in 1971. It is sponsored by the Marshfield Clinic (a 160 physician, multi-specialty group practice), St. Joseph's Hospital, Blue Cross of Wisconsin, and Surgical Care Blue Shield. The plan serves over 55,000 residents in rural Wisconsin, incorporating all or parts of seven counties. Like Fallon and Kaiser, the plan is a group practice HMO with salaried physicians. However, the fact that it includes the major providers in the area gives it the character or appearance of an individual practice association (IPA) HMO. An IPA HMO contracts with most or all physicians in an area to provide services, usually on a fee-for-service basis. The physicians retain their private offices, thus further distinguishing the IPA from the group model, where services are usually centralized at a clinic. Marshfield is also unusual in that it maintains a large fee-for-service clientele and the physicians are often unaware of which patients are HMO members and which patients are fee-for-service.\\n\\nIn the first contract year, HCFA capitation to Marshfield was set at 99 percent of the Area Prevailing Cost. As in Fallon, an AAPCC could not be calculated due to the unavailability of data on age, sex, welfare status, and institutional status of the Medicare enrollees. In the second year, when data were available, reimbursement was set at 98 percent of the AAPCC.\\n\\nEnrollees receive the basic Medicare benefits as well as reduced coinsurance and deductibles, preventive services, and unlimited hospital days.\\n\\n\\nStudy Population\\n\\nThe study compares pre-enrollment reimbursement experience for two groups: Medicare beneficiaries who are HMO enrollees and a comparable group of Medicare beneficiaries living in the same geographic area. All beneficiaries who had enrolled in the three HMOs as of April 1981 were initially selected for inclusion. Of these, 2,100 persons had had some previous HMO and/or GPPP experience. (Most were already members of Kaiser whose membership was changed to the risk contract.) These persons were removed from the analysis because their pre-enrollment experience would not represent reimbursement in a non-HMO setting. This left 19,518 persons for whom enrollment in one of the three demonstrations represented their first HMO experience. Disability beneficiaries (N = 550) were excluded because there were too few for a separate analysis. Forty persons had end-stage renal disease and were not included. Finally, there were 840 beneficiaries who were not residents of the counties for which data were collected.9 As a result, 18,088 HMO enrollees were included in the study. Of the persons without previous HMO experience, the study population represents 93 percent of the total at-risk enrollment in these HMOs.\\n\\n\\nComparison Group\\n\\nDue to the large total Medicare enrollment in the service areas of the HMOs (nearly 250,000 persons) and the problems in manipulating such a large file, a 5 percent sample (based on the terminal digits of the Health Insurance Claim number) of people living in the HMO catchment areas and not subsequently enrolling in the HMO was selected for the comparison group. As with the HMO sample, persons with previous GPPP or HMO experience, disability beneficiaries, those with end-stage renal disease, and persons not residents of the target counties were removed from the study. In total, 15,381 people were included in the comparison group.\\n\\nBoth the HMO enrollee and comparison groups were composed of aged Medicare beneficiaries, living in the same geographic area, who were alive in 1980. Therefore, for the years under examination (1976 through 1979), all persons were survivors. Because people use many more services in their last year of life than surviving Medicare beneficiaries, any bias for this phenomenon has been removed by including only survivors in the enrollee and comparison groups.10\\n\\n\\nData\\n\\nWe derived utilization and reimbursement data from the Medicare Statistical System (MSS). The MSS includes all billing claims for which Medicare reimburses. We developed a special file for the HMO demonstration projects, one which includes 100 percent of the Part A and Part B bills11 for residents of designated counties in the United States. The bills were compiled by residence of the beneficiary so that any use outside of the county is included. The file includes all Medicare bills incurred during calendar years 1976 through 1979 for residents of these counties. Because all bills include the unique beneficiary claim number, it was possible to link all bills with each individual in the HMO and comparison groups. Some enrollees and members of the comparison group undoubtedly moved during the 1976 to 1979 period; this change of address could affect the reimbursement rates.\\n\\nIf a person was eligible to receive services in 1976, for example, but did not live in one of these counties, his or her reimbursements would have been missed, thus biasing the reimbursement rates downward. This potential migration bias is discussed in the following section.\\n\\nThe Continuous Medicare History Sample (CMHS) is a 5 percent longitudinal sample of Medicare beneficiaries which includes people's addresses by year. It was therefore possible to link beneficiaries in the study (all of the comparison group because it was also a 5 percent sample and 5 percent of the HMO enrollees) with CMHS residence data to check for migration bias. Table 1 shows the results of this analysis. In the Fallon area, of those HMO enrollees living in the county in 1980 who were Medicare eligibles in 1976, 97.1 percent lived in the county in 1976. The figure for the comparison group was 95.1 percent. Thus, it appears that the comparison group rates are biased downward to a slightly greater extent than are the HMO enrollee rates. The percent of people living in the Kaiser area counties in 1976 was almost identical for the HMO enrollee and comparison groups (89.9 percent and 89.6 percent, respectively). Both groups were, therefore, biased downward to the same extent. In the Marshfield area, a higher percent of HMO enrollees 95.9 percent) lived in the counties in 1976 than did comparison group beneficiaries (90.3 percent). Comparison group rates in Marshfield are biased downward to a greater extent than HMO enrollee rates.\\n\\n\\nUse of Person-Years\\n\\nThe analysis consisted primarily of comparisons of rates of reimbursement between the HMO and comparison groups. It was important, therefore, not to include in the at-risk population persons who were not eligible to receive benefits at the time reimbursements were counted. For instance, a person age 67 in 1980 was not at risk of incurring Medicare reimbursements in 1976.12 To accurately relate reimbursements to eligibility, we calculated months of eligibility for each individual for each of the years 1976 through 1979. This was done by counting eligibility from the time of entitlement. (Part A and Part B months of entitlement were calculated separately.) Entitlement dates were available from the Medicare master beneficiary record. We then used total person years of eligibility to calculate rates of reimbursement for each age/sex group within each HMO area. Table 2 shows the number of persons and the total person years of Medicare Part A eligibility for the HMO comparison groups for the Fallon, Marshfield, and Kaiser areas. In the Fallon area, the 5,365 HMO enrollees accounted for 3,288 person years of Medicare Part A eligibility in 1976. The 4,090 persons in the comparison group accounted for 2,999 eligibility person years in 1976. Person years increased substantially each year as more persons reached 65 and became entitled.\\n\\n\\nAdjustments for AAPCC Factors\\n\\nThe comparison group reimbursement rates in each HMO area serve as the basis for computing expected rates for the HMO enrollees, since the procedure produced a comparison group similar to the enrollees in terms of survival and residency. We used AAPCC underwriting factors to produce expected rates for the HMO enrollees. The Office of Financial and Actuarial Analysis provided the most recent age, sex, institutional status, and Medicare welfare status distributions for the total population in the three HMO areas and for the beneficiaries who enrolled in the HMOs. We took the age and sex of Medicare beneficiaries directly from the Master Beneficiary Records maintained by HCFA. We determined welfare status on the basis of whether Medicaid pays for (or “buys in”) the Part B premium for Medicare beneficiaries. This information also was available from the Master Beneficiary Records. Institutional status is not routinely collected or maintained as part of the Medicare Statistical System. Therefore, these data had to be collected through surveys of long-term care facilities (Trieger et al., 1981). The AAPCC adjustment is described in detail in the Technical Note.13\\n\\n\\nCounty Adjustments\\n\\nTo control for county differences in prices, access to care, and utilization patterns, we adjusted the reimbursement rates in the analysis by weighting the county-specific reimbursement rates of the comparison group to reflect the county distribution of HMO enrollees. In effect, this results in a reimbursement rate for individuals in the comparison group as if they had the same county distribution as the HMO enrollees.\\n\\nIt is possible that HMOs could enroll beneficiaries from parts of counties that either have higher or lower reimbursement rates than the county as a whole. If so, the comparison group would not be exactly matched to the enrollee group. However, reimbursement under the AAPCC formula is based on the total county experience. Therefore, to be consistent with Medicare AAPCC reimbursement policy, we did not adjust for intra-county variation in reimbursement patterns.\\n\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe analyses consist of year-by-year comparisons of the average reimbursements per HMO enrollee with those of the comparison group with the AAPCC adjustment. We calculated reimbursement rates for each of the years 1976 through 1979 and for the four years combined. We separated reimbursements into inpatient reimbursements, physician and outpatient department reimbursements,14 and total reimbursements. Total reimbursements include payments for skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies, as well as inpatient, physician, and outpatient services.\\n\\n\\nSignificance Tests\\n\\nBoth the comparison group and the HMO enrollees were treated as samples from a universe of persons.15 We calculated variances for the inpatient reimbursement rates, the outpatient/physician reimbursement rates, and total reimbursement rates. We calculated variances for HMO enrollees and comparison groups separately and for each of the four years of data. We also tested the differences in means for significance assuming independent samples and populations with unequal variances, as shown below:t\\n\\n=S\\n\\ncomp2\\n\\nN\\n\\ncomp+S\\n\\nHMO2\\n\\nN\\n\\nHMO\\n\\nX\\n\\n¯\\n\\ncomp−X\\n\\n¯\\n\\nHMO\\n\\nWe performed a two tailed test because there was reason to believe that the selection bias could operate in either direction.\\n\\nWe used the Bonferroni multiple comparison t-test to compare the two groups over the four years. This test permits comparison of more than one pair of estimates while maintaining an overall significance level of .05.\\n\\nThe four-year estimates are weighted means of the annual means. Since there is a large overlap of sampling units (persons) from year to year, the variance of the four-year estimates will include covariance terms. The formula is as follows:16v\\n\\n=\\n\\n[\\n\\n∑i\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n4n\\n\\ni⋅s\\n\\ni\\n\\n2+\\n\\n∑i\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n4∑j\\n\\n>i\\n\\n4\\n\\n2n\\n\\nij⋅r\\n\\nij⋅s\\n\\ni⋅s\\n\\nj⋅p\\n\\nij]\\n\\n/\\n\\n(n\\n\\n1+n\\n\\n2+n\\n\\n3+n\\n\\n4)2\\n\\nwhere ni = sample size for the ith year\\n\\nsi2 = unit variance for the ith year\\n\\nnij = size of sample overlap for the ith and jth years\\n\\nrij = correlation coefficient for reimbursement for the ith and jth years\\n\\npij = proportion of ith year overlapping the jth year.\\n\\nThe test statistic takes the same form as above, substituting\\n\\nvcomp for s2comp/ncomp and vHMO and for S2HMO/nHMO.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nDemographic Characteristics\\n\\nThe age/sex distribution of HMO enrollees relative to the area population determines, in large part, their expected rates. Table 3 presents the age and sex distribution of the HMO enrollees and the comparison groups as well as counts of persons who are white and those with Medicaid buy-in into Part B of Medicare. Although the AAPCC does not adjust for race, this variable was included in this table to help determine its possible impact on use rates.\\n\\n\\nFallon\\n\\nEnrollees in the Fallon HMO are younger than those in the comparison group. Almost half (48 percent) of the HMO enrollees are age 65 to 69, whereas only one-third (33 percent) of the comparison group falls into this age group.\\n\\nAt the other end of the age distribution, those above the age of 80 account for 11 percent of the HMO enrollees and 25 percent of the comparison group. Thus, the overall reimbursement rate of the HMO enrollees is expected to be lower than that of the comparison group. Males constitute a higher percent of enrollees than of the comparison group (49 percent and 37 percent, respectively). The impact of this factor alone will be to raise the expected reimbursement rate for the enrollees, since males on average have reimbursement rates about 14 percent higher than females (Hirsch, in press). Welfare status, as measured by Medicaid buy-in for Part B coverage, shows that only 2 percent of the enrollees, but 13 percent of the comparison group, are receiving welfare benefits. This also tends to reduce the expected reimbursement rates for the HMO enrollees. Finally, the enrollees have proportionately more whites than the comparison group (98 percent and 92 percent, respectively).17\\n\\n\\nKaiser\\n\\nThe age/sex distribution of Medicare enrollees in the Kaiser HMO is very close to that of the comparison group. The differences that do exist occur at the older end of the age distribution. Six percent of HMO enrollees were age 85 years and over, whereas 11 percent of the comparison group fell into this age group. The racial composition of the two groups was nearly equal (95 percent white for HMO enrollees and 94 percent white for the comparison group). It was not possible to calculate the welfare status of the two groups because Oregon Medicaid does not have a buy-in provision for Part B benefits. It appears that the slightly younger age distribution of the HMO group will tend to reduce its expected reimbursement rates relative to the comparison group.\\n\\n\\nMarshfield\\n\\nThe HMO enrollees in this area were younger and had a higher percentage of males than the comparison group. Seventy percent of the HMO enrollees were age 65 to 74 as compared to 56 percent of the comparison group. Males accounted for 47 percent of the HMO group and 43 percent of the comparison group. In addition, 8 percent of the comparison group and only 1 percent of the HMO group were Medicaid recipients. Thus, the HMO group is heavily weighted with persons who have lower expected rates of reimbursements.\\n\\nIn summary, the data in Table 3 illustrate the need to adjust the observed reimbursements in the analysis. We did so using the AAPCC algorithm described in the methods section.\\n\\nAnother factor which could affect the reimbursement rates in the analysis is the distribution of enrollees and comparison group members by county. To the extent that an HMO draws persons disproportionately from high cost (or low cost) areas, the comparison of reimbursement rates will be biased upward (or downward).\\n\\n\\nTable 4 presents the county distribution of HMO enrollees, their respective comparison groups, and the total Medicare population within each of the three HMO areas. Because the Fallon enrollees were drawn almost entirely from Worcester County, Massachusetts, the comparison group was also limited to residents of Worcester. In the Kaiser area, there were small differences in county of residence between the two groups. A slightly higher percentage of HMO enrollees were residents of Multnomah County than the comparison group (64 percent and 58 percent, respectively).\\n\\nThere was a bigger difference in county of residence within the Marshfield area. Over one-half of the people in the comparison group were residents of Marathon County, whereas only one-fifth of the HMO enrollees lived in that county. Two-thirds of the HMO group were residents of Clark and Wood Counties. These counties accounted for 41 percent of the comparison group. In both the Kaiser and Marshfield areas, the comparison group, being a random sample of beneficiaries, tended to more closely approximate the county distribution of all Medicare beneficiaries than did the HMO enrollees.\\n\\n\\nReimbursement Rates\\n\\n\\nTables 5, 6, and 7 present the reimbursement comparisons for Fallon, Kaiser, and Marshfield, respectively. Comparison group reimbursement rates are presented unadjusted for AAPCC factors and after the AAPCC adjustment. The analysis centers on the differences in rates after AAPCC adjustment. The unadjusted comparison group rates are presented to illustrate the effects of the AAPCC adjustment.\\n\\n\\nFallon\\n\\nThe hospital inpatient reimbursement rate for the HMO enrollees in 1976 was $254 per person.18 By 1979 this had risen to $409. For the comparison group, the 1976 and 1979 adjusted rates were $311 and $504, respectively. In these four years the hospital inpatient reimbursement rates for HMO enrollees ranged from 18 percent to 32 percent below the adjusted reimbursement rates for the comparison group, with a four year average difference of 23 percent. In two of the years, the difference was statistically significant at the .05 confidence level. The four year average difference was also statistically significant.\\n\\nAlthough the differences were not as great as with inpatient reimbursements, the HMO enrollees in the Fallon area had lower Part B reimbursements than the adjusted comparison group. The HMO enrollee rate was $111 in 1976 and increased each year, up to $206 in 1979. The 1976 and 1979 adjusted rates for the comparison group were $121 and $244, respectively. The difference in rates between the two groups ranged from 8 percent to 18 percent during the four years. The four year average difference in rates was 13 percent ($160 for the HMO enrollee group and $183 for the comparison group). In 1978, 1979, and for the four year average, the differences were statistically significant.\\n\\nTotal reimbursements (which include skilled nursing facility and home health agency reimbursements as well as hospital inpatient, physician, and outpatient reimbursements) tended to reflect Part A patterns more closely than Part B, because Part A reimbursements per person are more than twice as great as Part B reimbursements. Over the four year period under consideration, total reimbursements per HMO enrollee ranged from 16 percent to 29 percent below the adjusted reimbursement rate for the comparison group. The four year average difference was 21 percent ($497 for the HMO enrollees and $625 for the comparison group). Except for 1976, each of the individual years and the four year average differences were statistically significant.\\n\\n\\nKaiser\\n\\nRelative reimbursement rates between the two groups in the Kaiser area paralleled those in the Fallon area (Table 6). Inpatient hospital reimbursements for the HMO enrollees increased from $200 in 1976 to $319 in 1979, with a four year average of $277. The comparison group's adjusted rates were $284 in 1976 and $496 in 1979, with a four year average of $369. The yearly differences in rates ranged from 10 percent to 36 percent, and the four year average difference was 25 percent. In two years, 1976 and 1979, and for the four year average, the differences were statistically significant.\\n\\nIn outpatient and physician reimbursements the HMO enrollees again had lower rates than the comparison group. But, as was the case with the Fallon enrollees, the differences were not as great as they were for inpatients. Adjusted differences between the two groups ranged between 3 and 16 percent. Per capita average reimbursements for the four years for the HMO enrollees and the comparison groups were $149 and $169, respectively, a 12 percent difference, which was statistically significant.\\n\\nAfter adjusting for AAPCC factors, the differences between the two groups for total reimbursements ranged from 7 percent in 1977 to 32 percent in 1979. The four year average total reimbursement rate for the HMO enrollees was $436, which was 21 percent below the adjusted total reimbursement rate of the comparison group ($554). Results were statistically significant every year except 1977, and they were also significant for the four year average.\\n\\n\\nMarshfield\\n\\nComparisons for Marshfield (Table 7) are markedly different from those found either in Fallon or Kaiser. Differences between the two groups in hospital inpatient reimbursement rates were smaller in Marshfield than in the other two areas. In 1978, the reimbursement rate for the HMO enrollees was 8 percent higher than the corresponding adjusted rate for the comparison group. In the three other years, the HMO enrollee rates ranged from 7 to 15 percent below the adjusted comparison group rates. Over all four years, the HMO enrollee rate was only 4 percent below that of the comparison group. In none of the four years, nor in the four year average, were the AAPCC adjusted differences statistically significant.\\n\\nWith regard to physician and outpatient reimbursements, the HMO enrollees were heavier users than the comparison group (with adjustment). HMO enrollees' reimbursement rates ranged from 11 percent higher in 1979 to 34 percent higher in 1978 (statistically significant) than the comparison group. Over all four years, the HMO enrollee rate of $159 was 22 percent higher than the comparison group adjusted rate of $131. It was also statistically significant.\\n\\nNaturally, the higher inpatient reimbursements for the comparison group and the higher physician and outpatient reimbursements for the HMO enrollees tended to offset each other in the total reimbursement rates. In two of the years (1976 and 1979), the adjusted total reimbursements for the comparison group are higher; in the other two years (1977 and 1978), the HMO enrollee rates are higher. As a result, the four year average shows the HMO enrollee total reimbursements of $403 per person to be 4 percent greater than the AAPCC adjusted reimbursement rate of $388 for the comparison group. None of the total reimbursement differences were statistically significant.\\n\\nThe Marshfield results are similar to a previous study of self-selection at Marshfield (Broida et al., 1975). In that study of enrolled persons under age 65, pre-enrollment ambulatory use was higher than that of a comparable group using fee-for-service medical care. There was little difference in the use of hospital care.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nTwo conclusions can be drawn from the reimbursement analyses. First, in each of the three HMO areas HMO enrollee reimbursement rates were lower than unadjusted reimbursement rates for the comparison groups. Because the enrollees tended to be younger and less likely to be on welfare, this was to be expected. The AAPCC formula, by controlling for these factors, should have reduced the differences between the groups. Before AAPCC adjustment, the HMO enrollee total reimbursement rates in Fallon and Kaiser were 31 percent and 29 percent lower than their respective comparison groups. With AAPCC adjustment, these differences were reduced to 21 percent, a 32 percent reduction in Fallon and a 28 percent reduction in Kaiser. In Marshfield, the AAPCC adjustment resulted in the HMO total reimbursement rates changing from 14 percent below the comparison group rate to 4 percent above the comparison group rate. Thus the AAPCC is at least partially successful in determining an appropriate reimbursement rate for HMOs.\\n\\nSecond, despite the use of an AAPCC adjustment to the data, significant differences between HMO enrollee and comparison groups remain in two of the three HMOs. Under the assumption that pre-enrollment experience is predictive of future experience, apparently there are selection factors for which AAPCC does not control which can affect enrollment in HMOs and subsequent financial experience.\\n\\n\\nAge/Sex Adjustment\\n\\nThe possibility also exists that one or more AAPCC factors are inappropriate adjustors and that a better adjustment mechanism can be developed. It was not the purpose of this study to develop new actuarial adjustment procedures. Nevertheless, simpler methods of adjusting rate data do exist. A typical method of adjusting health related data is direct age/sex standardization. It is of interest, therefore, to perform an age/sex standardization and compare the results to the AAPCC adjustment.\\n\\n\\nTable 8 shows 1976 to 1979 average reimbursement rates broken into age/sex categories. In Fallon, the unadjusted percent difference between the two groups is – 31 percent. In nine of the ten age/sex cells, the HMO enrollees had lower reimbursement rates. In the tenth cell (males age 80-84), the HMO group was 1 percent higher. In six of the cells, the difference was greater than 30 percent.\\n\\nIn Kaiser, the total unadjusted difference was – 29 percent, and in all ten age/sex cells the HMO enrollees had lower reimbursement rates. In six of the cells the difference was greater than 30 percent.\\n\\nIn Marshfield, the total unadjusted difference was – 14 percent. The comparison group in Marshfield is smaller than in the other areas which leads to greater variation between cells. In seven of the cells, the comparison group had higher reimbursement rates, while in three cells the HMO enrollees had the higher rates. These variations are probably due to both a) the small difference in total reimbursements for the groups as a whole and b) the relatively small number of persons in the individual cells for the comparison group.\\n\\n\\nTable 9 shows the age/sex adjusted total reimbursement rates and the AAPCC adjusted rates. In each HMO area the age/sex adjustment reduces the difference between the two groups, but not as much as the AAPCC adjustment does.\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThe intent of this study was to determine whether an adverse or favorable selection process existed among Medicare beneficiaries enrolling in each of three HMOs contracting with HCFA to provide services to beneficiaries. This was done by comparing the pre-enrollment reimbursement experience of Medicare beneficiaries who enrolled in HMOs with a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the same geographic area. Because reimbursement to an HMO is based on the AAPCC for the area in which the HMO is located, we applied AAPCC adjustments to the rates to control for differences in age, sex, welfare status, and institutional status.\\n\\nIn two of the three HMO areas, Fallon and Kaiser, pre-enrollment rates for the HMO enrollees were significantly lower than the reimbursement rates among the comparison group beneficiaries, both before and after adjustment for AAPCC factors. This indicates a selection process which favors the HMO. The differential was greatest for inpatient services but existed for outpatient and physician services as well. Therefore, the argument that people who choose HMOs are predisposed toward higher use of ambulatory services in lieu of inpatient services is not supported for the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in these HMOs. The pre-enrollment experience for Fallon and Kaiser is similar to that reported earlier for Group Health Cooperative (Eggers, 1980).\\n\\nThe Marshfield experience was different. For this HMO, after adjusting for AAPCC factors, there was no statistically significant difference between the HMO and comparison groups in total reimbursements. While the HMO enrollees had lower inpatient reimbursement rates, these were offset by a higher use of ambulatory services (outpatient and physician services).\\n\\nThe results of this study have implications both for Medicare payments under prepayment mechanisms and for the selection issue in general. First, HCFA created the AAPCC methodology to adjust HMO payments to account for variations in enrollment mix by age, sex, welfare status, and institutional status and to take into account regional variation in health care costs. A major concern has been the extent to which unmeasured beneficiary characteristics that affect utilization and reimbursement are present in people who enroll in HMOs. The results in Fallon and Kaiser (as well as GHC) suggest that important decisions can exist among the enrollee population which the present AAPCC adjustment mechanism cannot correct. This is not to say that the AAPCC factors are inappropriate or inaccurate for calculating reimbursement amounts. As this study shows, the AAPCC mechanism accounted for part of the variation in pre-enrollment reimbursement rates. Moreover, compared with a traditional age/sex adjustment, the AAPCC reduced reimbursement differences to a greater extent. Yet this study seems to indicate that the present AAPCC factors are not sufficient.\\n\\nHCFA is currently evaluating the AAPCC mechanism. The AAPCC calculation involves yearly surveys of the institutionalized population in each HMO area. This procedure is expensive, time consuming, and subject to severe under-reporting (Trieger et al., 1981).\\n\\nThe second implication of the study relates to the selection bias issue. Although it is not possible to rule out enrollment measures designed to select healthier beneficiaries for the HMOs, there are reasons to believe that such selection did not take place. First, all three HMOs enrolled thousands of people over a relatively short period of time. This alone suggests a fair open enrollment process. Second, the demonstrations were closely monitored to assure a fair enrollment process. Third, it is not easy to determine risk, even if the HMOs were intent on doing so. Finally, Marshfield's failure to experience favorable selection is further evidence that the HMOs were not actively encouraging it.\\n\\nAssuming that the selection bias was on the part of the enrollees, there is reason to suspect that, in Luft's terms, integration into the health system may be a determining factor. The major factor differentiating Marshfield from the Kaiser and Fallon HMOs (and GHC) is that Marshfield operates much like an IPA, whereas the other three are closed panel HMOs. People enrolling in Fallon, Kaiser, or GHC probably had to give up their previous sources of care. Because Marshfield is essentially the only significant provider of care in its area, most enrollees probably already were receiving care from a Marshfield physician and therefore did not have to change physicians. Fallon and Kaiser may have enrolled more persons who did not have a personal physician or a strong attachment to their previous physician.\\n\\nIf lack of integration is a key factor in determining enrollment in HMOs for the Medicare population, it could have two consequences. First, it might be that the study HMOs enrolled persons who simply had a lower need for care. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics show that the primary reason given for not having a physician is that the person doesn't perceive a need for one (Blumberg, 1978). In this case, the HMO would be achieving favorable selection.\\n\\nAlternatively, the low reimbursement rates and possible lack of integration prior to enrollment could indicate unmet need and underservice among these populations. If so, the HMOs may be increasing access to care for these persons by enrolling them, and the cost of providing services to a population without previous access to care might increase. The question of whether low pre-enrollment use rates represent less need for care or less access to care cannot be determined simply by examining pre-enrollment patterns. What happens to these patients after enrollment is equally important. Continued low use rates would support the favorable selection process hypothesis. If use rates rise and remain high, lack of access would appear to be a determinant of low pre-enrollment rates.\\n\\n\\nTechnical Note: Calculation of AAPCC Adjustment\\n\\nIn the reimbursement formula for HMOs under risk, the ratio of the underwriting index for the enrolled group to the underwriting index for the county population is used to adjust the county per capita cost to reflect the characteristics of the HMO enrollees.\\n\\n\\nEquation 1 represents the AAPCC formula:(1)AAPCC\\n\\n=\\n\\nUSPCC\\n\\n×APCC\\n\\nCo.\\n\\nAPCC\\n\\nU.S.×∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n30\\n\\nU\\n\\ni×E\\n\\ni HMO/∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n30\\n\\nE\\n\\ni HMO\\n\\n∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n30\\n\\nU\\n\\ni×E\\n\\ni Co./∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n30\\n\\nE\\n\\ni Co.\\n\\nwhere: AAPCC = adjusted average per capita cost\\n\\nUSPCC = U.S. average per capita cost to the Medicare program\\n\\n\\nAAPCCo.AAPCCU.S. = ratio of per capita reimbursement in the county to the U.S. (five year average)\\n\\nand: Ui = a unique underwriting index which represents the ratio of risk for a particular subset of the Medicare population to the national average. Thirty population subsets are defined by the four variables: age (5 groups), sex (two groups), institutional and welfare status (three groups).\\n\\nEi = the number of Medicare beneficiaries in a unique underwriting index cell. Table A-1 shows the underwriting factors used for aged Medicare beneficiaries.\\n\\nThus, the last factor represents the ratio of relative cost differences in the HMO to that of non-HMO enrollees due to demographic characteristics. It is calculated by dividing the number representing the relative risk of HMO enrollees by the number representing the relative risk of non-HMO enrollees in a given county. The product of all these factors gives the AAPCC.\\n\\nIn this study, we used the ratio of the HMO enrollee underwriting index to the comparison group underwriting index to adjust the comparison group reimbursement rates to obtain an expected average reimbursement rate for the HMO enrollees.\\n\\nSubstituting the comparison group reimbursement rate into the AAPCC equation:E\\n\\nReim\\n\\nHMO=\\n\\nAAPCC\\n\\nAdjusted\\n\\nReim\\n\\ncomp=Reim\\n\\ncomp×∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n30\\n\\nU\\n\\ni×E\\n\\ni HMO/∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n30\\n\\nE\\n\\ni HMO\\n\\n∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n30\\n\\nU\\n\\ni×E\\n\\ni Co./∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\n\\n30\\n\\nE\\n\\ni Co.\\n\\nwhere: E ReimHMO = the expected average reimbursement rate for the HMO\\n\\nAAPCC Adjusted Reimcomp = the AAPCC adjusted per capita reimbursement rate for the comparison group\\n\\nReimcomp = the unadjusted per capita reimbursement rate for the comparison group. The data available for the calculation of the AAPCC weighting factors are described in the following sections.\\n\\n\\nFallon\\n\\nEstimates of HMO enrollee and county area, age, sex, welfare, and institutional status were available for 1981. The calculations were done for both the enrollee and comparison groups, thus accounting for all the AAPCC factors.\\n\\n\\nKaiser\\n\\nPopulation estimates for the four AAPCC factors were not available for 1981. These data were available for the general population in this service area for 1980. We therefore calculated an underwriting index for the control group based on all factors. Data for the enrollees were limited to age/sex distribution by county, and we calculated an underwriting index on the basis of these distributions. The net effect of omitting enrollee welfare and institutional status from the AAPCC is to bias this factor downward for the enrollee group. This in turn reduces the expected reimbursement rate, making it easier to detect an adverse selection and more difficult to detect a favorable selection for the HMO.\\n\\n\\nMarshfield\\n\\nAs with Kaiser, population distributions by AAPCC factor were available for 1980, but HMO enrollment distributions were not available. We separated the HMO group enrollment counts into age, sex, and welfare status by county. The AAPCC for the HMO enrollment group is biased downward due to the absence of data on institutional status. As with the Kaiser enrollment group, this made it easier to detect adverse selection and more difficult to detect favorable selection.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Pre-Enrollment Reimbursement Patterns of Medicare Beneficiaries Enrolled in “At-Risk” HMOs', 'journal_title': 'Health Care Financing Review'}\n",

Our&#x000a0;data demonstrate that C5aR1 deficiency or blockade not&#x000a0;only reduces renal bacterial load at all stages of infection but also attenuates tissue inflammation and tubulointerstitial&#x000a0;fibrosis, suggesting a pathogenic role for C5aR1 in experimental chronic kidney infection. Mechanistic studies suggest that C5aR1-mediated bacterial colonization of tubular epithelium, persistent local inflammatory responses, and impairment of the phagocytic function of MO/M&#x003a6;s could contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic kidney infection. Thus, our data further support the notion that excessive or persistent tissue inflammation represents an important pathogenic mechanism in acute and chronic kidney infection.<xref rid=\"bib8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>, <xref rid=\"bib10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>, <xref rid=\"bib11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref></p><p>One of the important observations in this study is that C5aR1 deficiency or blockade C5aR1 reduced bacterial load at all stages of infection studied, even at the early stage of infection (day 2 or 3 after inoculation). This suggests that C5aR1 could have an impact on early UPEC colonization of renal tract epithelium. In support of this hypothesis, our recent work (in a separate study) has revealed that bacterial adhesion and tissue colonization mediated by the expression of mannosyl residues&#x02014;a ligand for type 1 fimbriae that we detected on the luminal surface of the renal tubular and bladder epithelium&#x02014;is increased by C5aR1-induced signaling (unpublished data). In addition to the impact on bacterial colonization, in the present study, we have also found that treatment of MO/M&#x003a6;s with C5a significantly reduced their bactericidal activity, suggesting that C5a/C5aR1 interaction has a negative regulatory effect on the phagocytic function of MO/M&#x003a6;s, which is consistent with the well-recognized phenomenon of C5a/C5aR1 signaling being a strong driver of inflammation and having a negative impact on the phagocytic function of phagocytes.<xref rid=\"bib24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>, <xref rid=\"bib29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref> Therefore, C5a/C5aR1 interaction&#x02013;mediated enhancement of UPEC adhesion/colonization of renal tract epithelium (possibly through upregulation of&#x000a0;expression of mannosyl residue on the luminal surface of renal tubular and bladder epithelium) and impairment of phagocytic function of phagocytes could contribute to the early and persistent bacterial colonization of the kidney that we observed in this model.</p><p>Another important observation from this study is that following renal infection, C5aR1 deficiency or blockade resulted in a reduction in renal tissue inflammation (i.e., cellular infiltration, tubular atrophy, and intrarenal gene expression of proinflammatory factors). These findings strongly suggest that C5aR1 has a critical role in upregulating local inflammatory responses to UPEC, which contributes to chronic inflammation of the kidney and development of renal scarring. To explore the cellular basis of the C5a/C5aR1 axis contributing to tissue inflammation, we examined the impact of C5aR1 on inflammatory cell infiltration and found that <italic>C5aR1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> deficiency not only reduced the accumulation of leukocytes and MO/M&#x003a6;s but specifically reduced the population of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> proinflammatory MO/M&#x003a6;s following renal infection. These findings suggest that C5aR1 not only promotes chemotaxis of leukocytes but also plays an important role in modulating the phenotype of infiltrating cells. C5aR1 deficiency resulting in overall inhibition of cellular infiltration and accumulation of proinflammatory MO/M&#x003a6;s could contribute to the control and resolution of local inflammation.</p><p>In addition to cellular infiltration, we also examined the impact of C5a/C5aR1 interaction on cellular responses to UPEC. We focused on RTECs and MO/M&#x003a6;s, as both types of cells express C5aR1 and also are important sources of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors in the kidney. Our findings that C5a stimulation up-regulated UPEC-induced production of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors by cultured RTECs and MO/M&#x003a6;s suggest that (i) engagement of C5aR1 on both inflammatory and renal parenchymal cells could contribute to local tissue inflammation and (ii) the additive effect of C5a and UPEC on cytokine production by RTECs and MO/M&#x003a6;s could be explained by the interaction of C5aR1 and Toll-like receptor signaling, as suggested by a previous study in a lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production model.<xref rid=\"bib30\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>30</sup></xref></p><p>Additionally, our study found that C5aR1 has a big impact on the development of renal fibrosis.

Our finding that C5aR1 has opposing effects on renal expression of profibrogenic and antifibrogenic factors supports the concept that C5aR1 influences the dynamic balance between tissue destruction and repair after renal infection, favoring the promotion of tissue destruction and impairing the repair process.</p><p>To conclude, this study is the first to define a novel and important role of C5aR1 in the pathogenesis of experimental chronic pyelonephritis. It also suggests that C5aR1-dependent enhancement of UPEC colonization of renal tract epithelium and excessive local inflammatory responses, as well as impairment of phagocytic function of phagocytes, contribute to the chronic inflammation and renal fibrosis. Our observation that blocking the C5a/C5aR1 axis curtailed the pathology suggests a therapeutic potential for targeting C5aR1 in chronic kidney infection. Although antibiotics can be used to treat the UTI, there is the emerging threat of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in urology in addition to the well-known frequent recurrence and persistence of infection.

For C5aR1 antagonist treatment experiments, WT mice were administered C5aR1 peptide antagonist (PMX53, Ac-Phe-cyclo[Orn-Pro-dCha-Trp-Arg]) or control agent (random sequence peptide) (synthesized by GenScript, Shanghai, China) by subcutaneous injection (1 mg/kg daily) starting at different stages of infection and for different times.</p></sec><sec id=\"sec3.3\"><title>Assessment of renal histopathological features</title><p>Paraffin sections (4 &#x003bc;m) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid&#x02013;Schiff stain, or Sirius red. Stained kidney sections were scanned with a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0 HT slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamtsu, Japan) and viewed using NDP.view2 software. Renal histopathological changes were assessed on periodic acid&#x02013;Schiff&#x02013; and hematoxylin and eosin&#x02013;stained sections using a 6-point scale in which 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 indicated normal, very little, very mild, mild, moderate, and severe histological lesions, respectively. The assessment was based on histopathological changes (i.e., cellular infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial inflammation) that were mainly located at the corticomedullary junction area. Renal fibrosis was assessed on Sirius red&#x02013;stained sections. The positively stained areas were quantified by imaging analysis (ImageJ software; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Briefly, 6 to 8 corticomedullary junction viewing fields selected from appropriate areas within each kidney were examined. Positively stained areas were expressed as a percentage of the whole field area (1.92 mm<sup>2</sup>). All the aforementioned quantitative analyses were performed in a blinded fashion by 2 experienced persons.</p></sec><sec id=\"sec3.4\"><title>Measurement of bacterial load in the kidney and bladder</title><p>Total bacterial load in kidney and bladder tissue was measured by the agar plate assay as previously described, with modifications.<xref rid=\"bib26\" ref-type=\"bibr\"><sup>26</sup></xref> In brief, the tissue was weighed and subsequently homogenized in 2 ml (for the kidney) or 1 ml (for the bladder) of phosphate-buffered saline. A quantity of 100 &#x003bc;l of a series dilution of homogenates were plated on cysteine-, lactose-, and electrolyte-deficient plates. After incubation of the plates for 24 hours, bacterial CFUs on the agar plates were manually counted and expressed as CFU per gram of tissue.</p></sec><sec id=\"sec3.5\"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are shown either as the mean &#x000b1; SEM or the readout of individual mice.

Kidney infection is usually caused by ascending infections of the lower urinary tract. Recurrent or long-standing (chronic) kidney infections can result in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which is a much more common situation in children or in patients with diabetes mellitus or urinary obstructions. Although antibiotics are available to treat the disease, a number of challenges remain, including frequent recurrence, persistence of infection, and the increasing risk for resistance to antibiotics.1, 4 It is therefore imperative to improve our current understanding of the pathogenesis of UTIs and develop novel therapeutic strategies to improve current treatment.\\n\\nUropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary cause of UTIs, and most UPEC express a variety of fimbriae (e.g., P, type 1) that enable them to bind and invade uroepithelial cells.5 Although innate immunity plays an essential role in the first line of host defense against pathogens, in UTIs most human UPEC strains are resistant to complement-mediated killing.6, 7 Bacteria-mediated acute inflammatory responses can cause renal tissue inflammation and epithelium destruction, allowing bacteria to enter the underlying tissue,8, 9, 10 and persistent bacterial colonization and chronic inflammation can lead to tubular atrophy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.11\\n\\nC5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) is a 350–amino acid glycoprotein and member of the G-protein–coupled receptor superfamily of proteins that is expressed in myeloid cells (e.g., neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages [MO/MΦs]) and nonmyeloid cells, including renal tubular epithelial cells.12 The well-known ligand for C5aR1 is C5a (also called an anaphylatoxin), which is a 74–amino acid glycopolypeptide fragment generated during complement activation by cleavage of complement C5. The interaction of C5aR1 with C5a mediates a broad spectrum of proinflammatory reactions, such as an increase in vascular permeability, recruitment of leukocytes to sites of injury or infection, generation of cytotoxic oxygen radicals (by granulocytes), and generation of proinflammatory mediators (by myeloid and nonmyeloid cells). A large body of research has demonstrated that C5a/C5aR1 signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of a wide range of inflammatory pathologies, including renal disorders.12, 13, 14 Furthermore, there is compelling evidence from sepsis studies indicating that C5a/C5aR1 signaling can provide counterregulatory effects in host defense through impairment of innate immune cell function and induce excessive inflammatory responses.15 Pathogenic roles for C5a/C5aR1 signaling have also been reported in a number of other animal models of infectious disease, such as malaria, acute pneumococcal otitis media, and gram-negative bacteremia.16, 17, 18 However, the roles for C5aR1 in chronic kidney disease, particularly under conditions of infection, are largely unknown.\\n\\nGiven that (i) C5aR1 is expressed in renal resident and inflammatory cells and is up-regulated under pathological conditions,12, 19, 20, 21, 22 (ii) C5a/C5aR1 signaling is a strong driver of tissue inflammation,13, 14 and (iii) C5a/C5aR1 signaling has a negative impact on phagocyte function,23, 24 together with the pathological features of chronic kidney infection (i.e., persistent bacterial colonization, tissue inflammation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis),11, 25 we hypothesized that C5aR1 may play a pathogenic role in chronic kidney infection. To test this hypothesis, we used a well-established murine model of chronic pyelonephritis induced by the UPEC strain IH11128 and C5aR1-deficient (C5aR1-/-) mice, as well as a C5aR1 antagonist, to determine the role of C5aR1 in chronic kidney infection (i.e., bacterial load, tissue inflammation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis). We also investigated the cellular basis of the C5a/C5aR1 axis, which contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic kidney infection, by examining the influence of C5aR1 on cellular infiltration of the kidney following renal infection. In addition, we measured the effects of C5a/C5aR1 on the production of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors by primary cultured renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) and MO/MΦs in response to bacterial stimulation and assessed the impact of C5a/C5aR1 on the phagocytic function of MO/MΦs. Our data demonstrate that following infection, early and persistent bacterial colonization, renal inflammation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis are dependent on C5aR1, suggesting that C5aR1 facilities the pathogenesis of chronic kidney infection by enhancement of bacterial colonization of tubular epithelium, promotion of local inflammatory responses, and impairment of phagocytic function of MO/MΦs.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nC5aR1-/- mice have reduced bacterial load in the kidney and bladder following bladder inoculation with UPEC\\n\\nPrevious studies in a murine model of chronic kidney infection induced by IH11128 have shown that bacterial colonization of the kidney can be detected at 1 to 2 days after infection and persist for months.11 We therefore assessed bacterial load in the kidney and bladder of wild-type (WT) and C5aR1-/- mice at three stages of infection, namely, early (day 2), intermediate (day 14), and late (day 56) after infection, by counting bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) recovered from kidney or bladder tissue samples on agar plates.26 After bacterial inoculation into the bladder (postinfection), bacterial colonies in the kidney and bladder peaked at day 1 to day 2; afterwords, there was a trend. However, C5aR1-/- mice had significantly lower bacterial colony counts in the kidneys at all time points after infection (day 2, day 4, and day 56) and in the bladder at day 2 and day 14 after infection compared with WT mice (Figure\\xa01a and b). We also performed fluorescence microscopy analysis of bacterial colonies in infected kidney tissues from WT and C5aR1-/- mice at day 2 after inoculation with fluorescence-labeled bacteria. Consistent with the results of the agar plate assay, bacterial colonies in the renal tubular epithelium were significantly lower in C5aR1-/- mice compared with in WT mice (Figure\\xa01c and d). Collectively, these data demonstrate that C5aR1 deficiency reduces bacterial load in the kidney and bladder.\\n\\n\\nC5aR1 deficiency attenuates renal pathology following infection\\n\\nThe UPEC strain IH11128 used in this study lacks expression of P fimbriae; therefore, they do not cause severe tissue destruction. However, they do mediate the chronic inflammatory process within the renal parenchyma, leading to progressive tissue injury.11 We therefore assessed the renal histopathology of infected WT and C5aR1-/- mice at different stages of infection. Renal histopathological changes, including cellular infiltration, tubular damage, and interstitial inflammation, were observed at all time points after infection. Tubular atrophy and interstitial inflammation became more apparent at the later time points. The changes were predominantly located within the corticomedullary junction but were also observed in other areas (e.g., the outer cortex and inner medulla). On the basis of these changes, we performed histological scoring of periodic acid–Schiff– and hematoxylin and eosin–stained kidney sections from individual mice in the WT and C5aR1-/- groups. Compared with WT mice, C5aR1-/- mice exhibited attenuated renal histopathological lesions at all time points (days 2, 14, and 56) (Figure\\xa02a and b). We also assessed renal function in WT and C5aR1-/- mice after infection by measuring blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Blood urea nitrogen was not significantly elevated in all infected mice when compared with normal mice, but there was a trend toward increased blood urea nitrogen in WT mice at the late time point after infection (Figure\\xa02c). These data demonstrate that renal histopathological lesions and late functional impairment were reduced in C5aR1-/- mice after infection.\\n\\n\\nC5aR1 deficiency influences the extent and phenotype of cellular infiltrates in the kidney in response to infection\\n\\nCellular infiltration was further analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry at early and intermediate time points after infection, as described previously.10 Flow cytometry analysis of renal cell suspensions showed that when compared with WT, C5aR1-/- kidneys had lower numbers of leukocytes (CD45+) at day 2 after infection and a lower proportion of MO/MΦs (Ly6G-CD11b+) within CD45+ cells at day 14 after infection (Figure\\xa03a–c). In addition, compared with WT, C5aR1-/- kidneys had a lower Ly6Chi population and reduced ratios of Ly6Chi to Ly6Clo populations within the MO/MΦs (Ly6G-CD11b+) compartment at both day 2 and day 14 after infection (Figure\\xa03a, d, and e). However, C5aR1-/- kidneys had a similar proportion of neutrophils (Ly6G+) within CD45+ cells compared with WT kidneys at day 2 and day 14 after infection (Figure\\xa03a and f). Immunohistochemistry showed that when compared with WT, C5aR1-/- kidneys had lower numbers of CD45+ cells (day 2 after infection) and F4/80+ cells (day 14 after infection) than WT kidneys (Figure\\xa03g–3i), which is in agreement with the results of flow cytometry analysis. Collectively, these results indicate that C5aR1 deficiency not only caused a general reduction in cellular infiltration and MO/MΦ accumulation but also specifically reduced inflammatory monocytes' infiltration of the kidney in response to renal infection. However, C5aR1 deficiency did not cause a reduction of neutrophil infiltrate at the time points studied in this model.\\n\\n\\nC5aR1 deficiency attenuates renal tissue inflammation and fibrogenesis following renal infection\\n\\nPersistent tissue inflammation and fibrogenesis play an important role in the progression of chronic kidney disease. We therefore used semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to assess renal tissue inflammation and fibrogenesis of WT and C5aR1-/- mice following renal infection. Gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α] and interleukin-1β [IL-1β]), chemokines (keratinocyte-derived protein chemokine [KC], monocyte chemoattactant protein-1 [MCP-1]), chemokine receptor (C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 [CCR2]), and profibrogenic factors (transforming growth factor-β [TFG-β] and platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]) was significantly reduced in C5aR1-/- mice compared with in WT mice at all time points studied (Figure\\xa04a–4c). In contrast, gene expression of antifibrogenic factor (hepatocyte growth factor) was significantly higher in C5aR1-/- mice than in WT mice at day 2 and day 14 after infection (Figure\\xa04d). Collectively, these results indicate that absence of C5aR1 attenuates renal tissue inflammation and fibrogenesis following renal infection.\\n\\n\\nLess severe renal fibrosis develops in C5aR1-/- mice after infection\\n\\nTo further investigate the impact of C5aR1 on the development of renal fibrosis, we assessed the extent of collagen deposition and extracellular matrix production in kidneys from WT and C5aR1-/- mice following renal infection. Sirius red staining was performed on kidney sections at day 14 and day 56 after infection. Compared with WT kidneys, C5aR1-/- kidneys exhibited a significant reduction of Sirius red staining (Figure\\xa05a and b). We also examined gene expression of several major extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal proteins in kidneys from WT and C5aR1-/- mice at day 14 and day 56 after infection using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Intrarenal expression of mRNA encoding for extracellular matrix proteins (collagen I and fibronectin) and cytoskeleton proteins (α-smooth muscle and vimentin) was significantly reduced in C5aR1-/- mice compared with in WT mice. In contrast, C5aR1-/- mice had significantly higher levels of mRNA for collagen IV (which is required for renal tubular epithelial cell structural and functional integrity27) than did WT mice (Figure\\xa05c). Taken together, these findings indicate that C5aR1 deficiency protects mice from renal fibrosis and parenchymal loss following renal infection.\\n\\n\\nAntagonizing C5aR1 reduces renal inflammation and fibrosis following renal infection\\n\\nIn addition to studying C5aR1-/- mice, we used a well-known C5aR1 antagonist (PMX53)28 to assess whether this approach can curtail renal infection, tissue inflammation, and fibrosis. WT mice were administered PMX53 or control agent daily for 13 days. Consistent with observations made in C5aR1-/- mice, renal histopathology, tissue inflammation/fibrogenesis, collagen deposition, and bacterial load were significantly reduced in the kidneys of PMX53-treated mice compared with in the control group at day 14 after infection (Figure\\xa06a–e). These results further confirmed the pathogenic role for C5aR1 in this model and also suggest a therapeutic potential for targeting C5aR1 in chronic kidney infection. To further investigate whether the major effects of C5aR1 on chronic inflammation and renal fibrosis are dependent on the initial impact of C5aR1 or the subsequent responses, we performed an additional set of in\\xa0vivo experiments. WT mice were given PMX53 or control agent at the following different stages of infection: (i) starting at day 0 (2 hours before the inoculation) and continuing up to day 2 (early administration) and (ii) starting at day 3 after the inoculation and continuing up to day 13 (late administration). Early bacterial colonization was assessed at day 3 after infection following early administration. Mice that received PMX53 exhibited significantly fewer CFUs in the kidney compared with mice that received control agent (Figure\\xa06f). Chronic injury was assessed at day 14 after infection. Both early and late administration of PMX53 reduced renal fibrosis and tissue bacterial load, but early administration led to a more profound reduction compared with in the control group (Figure\\xa06g–i). These results suggest that the initial impact of C5aR1 plays an important role in the limit of bacterial load and subsequent chronic inflammation and renal fibrosis.\\n\\n\\nC5a/C5aR1 interaction amplifies bacteria-induced production of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors by RTECs and MO/MΦs\\n\\nOur in\\xa0vivo data presented in this article suggest a critical role for C5aR1 in renal tissue inflammation and fibrogenesis following renal infection. To explore the cellular basis for the C5a/C5aR1 axis contributing to renal tissue inflammation and fibrogenesis, we used primary cell culture systems for RTECs and MO/MΦs and then used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to assess the effects of C5a/C5aR1 interactions on production of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors by these cells in response to bacterial stimulation. Incubation with C5a alone led to only a small increase in proinflammatory and profibrogenic factor mRNA expression by RTECs and MO/MΦs. Incubation with heat-killed UPEC alone clearly increased mRNA expression of proinflammatory factors (i.e., tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, monocyte chemoattactant protein-1, and keratinocyte-derived protein chemokine) by RTECs and MO/MΦs. In the presence of C5a, mRNA expression levels for those proinflammatory factors were further increased in RTECs and MO/MΦs compared with in the absence of C5a. Combined heat-killed UPEC and C5a treatment also increased mRNA expression of profibrotic factors (i.e., transforming growth factor-β and platelet-derived growth factor) by RTECs and MO/MΦs compared with heat-killed UPEC or C5a treatment alone (Table\\xa01). Thus, our data indicate that engagement of C5aR1 amplifies UPEC-induced production of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors by RTECs and MO/MΦs.\\n\\n\\nC5a/C5aR1 interaction has a negative effect on the phagocytic function of phagocytes\\n\\nIn addition to the effects on cytokine production by MO/MΦs, we assessed the impact of C5a/C5aR1 interactions on the ability of phagocytes to kill bacteria by using primary MO/MΦs prepared from WT mice. MO/MΦs were pretreated with C5a (10 nM or 50 nM) for 4 hours and then used for bacterial uptake and intracellular killing assays. The uptake of UPEC was comparable in the control and C5a-treated MO/MΦs, whereas survival of intracellular UPEC was significantly increased in C5a-treated MO/MΦs compared with in the control group, indicating that C5a treatment caused impairment of the bactericidal activity of MO/MΦs but had no apparent effect on bacterial uptake (Figure\\xa07).\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nOur current understanding of the roles of C5a/C5aR1 in the pathogenesis of kidney disease is primarily based on studies in acute or non–pathogen-related injury. In this study we used a well-characterized murine model of ascending UTI to investigate the role of C5aR1 in chronic kidney injury. Our\\xa0data demonstrate that C5aR1 deficiency or blockade not\\xa0only reduces renal bacterial load at all stages of infection but also attenuates tissue inflammation and tubulointerstitial\\xa0fibrosis, suggesting a pathogenic role for C5aR1 in experimental chronic kidney infection. Mechanistic studies suggest that C5aR1-mediated bacterial colonization of tubular epithelium, persistent local inflammatory responses, and impairment of the phagocytic function of MO/MΦs could contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic kidney infection. Thus, our data further support the notion that excessive or persistent tissue inflammation represents an important pathogenic mechanism in acute and chronic kidney infection.8, 10, 11\\n\\nOne of the important observations in this study is that C5aR1 deficiency or blockade C5aR1 reduced bacterial load at all stages of infection studied, even at the early stage of infection (day 2 or 3 after inoculation). This suggests that C5aR1 could have an impact on early UPEC colonization of renal tract epithelium. In support of this hypothesis, our recent work (in a separate study) has revealed that bacterial adhesion and tissue colonization mediated by the expression of mannosyl residues—a ligand for type 1 fimbriae that we detected on the luminal surface of the renal tubular and bladder epithelium—is increased by C5aR1-induced signaling (unpublished data). In addition to the impact on bacterial colonization, in the present study, we have also found that treatment of MO/MΦs with C5a significantly reduced their bactericidal activity, suggesting that C5a/C5aR1 interaction has a negative regulatory effect on the phagocytic function of MO/MΦs, which is consistent with the well-recognized phenomenon of C5a/C5aR1 signaling being a strong driver of inflammation and having a negative impact on the phagocytic function of phagocytes.24, 29 Therefore, C5a/C5aR1 interaction–mediated enhancement of UPEC adhesion/colonization of renal tract epithelium (possibly through upregulation of\\xa0expression of mannosyl residue on the luminal surface of renal tubular and bladder epithelium) and impairment of phagocytic function of phagocytes could contribute to the early and persistent bacterial colonization of the kidney that we observed in this model.\\n\\nAnother important observation from this study is that following renal infection, C5aR1 deficiency or blockade resulted in a reduction in renal tissue inflammation (i.e., cellular infiltration, tubular atrophy, and intrarenal gene expression of proinflammatory factors). These findings strongly suggest that C5aR1 has a critical role in upregulating local inflammatory responses to UPEC, which contributes to chronic inflammation of the kidney and development of renal scarring. To explore the cellular basis of the C5a/C5aR1 axis contributing to tissue inflammation, we examined the impact of C5aR1 on inflammatory cell infiltration and found that C5aR1-/- deficiency not only reduced the accumulation of leukocytes and MO/MΦs but specifically reduced the population of Ly6Chi proinflammatory MO/MΦs following renal infection. These findings suggest that C5aR1 not only promotes chemotaxis of leukocytes but also plays an important role in modulating the phenotype of infiltrating cells. C5aR1 deficiency resulting in overall inhibition of cellular infiltration and accumulation of proinflammatory MO/MΦs could contribute to the control and resolution of local inflammation.\\n\\nIn addition to cellular infiltration, we also examined the impact of C5a/C5aR1 interaction on cellular responses to UPEC. We focused on RTECs and MO/MΦs, as both types of cells express C5aR1 and also are important sources of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors in the kidney. Our findings that C5a stimulation up-regulated UPEC-induced production of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors by cultured RTECs and MO/MΦs suggest that (i) engagement of C5aR1 on both inflammatory and renal parenchymal cells could contribute to local tissue inflammation and (ii) the additive effect of C5a and UPEC on cytokine production by RTECs and MO/MΦs could be explained by the interaction of C5aR1 and Toll-like receptor signaling, as suggested by a previous study in a lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production model.30\\n\\nAdditionally, our study found that C5aR1 has a big impact on the development of renal fibrosis. Less severe renal tubular interstitial fibrosis developed in C5aR1-/- mice than in WT mice following renal infection. The pathogenesis of renal fibrosis is complex, as multiple cell types and molecular pathways are involved. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the inflammatory microenvironment of the kidney after sustained injury is a key determinant of the dynamic balance between tissue destruction (tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis) and repair (tubular cell growth and resolution of renal inflammation and fibrosis).31, 32 Previous studies have shown that increased intrarenal expression of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors are strongly associated with renal fibrosis.32, 33, 34 Our finding of an association of reduced renal fibrosis with significant reduction of renal expression of an array of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors in C5aR1-/- mice suggests that C5a/C5aR1-mediated proinflammatory and profibrotic responses could contribute to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. In addition, previous studies have shown that the phenotype of the inflammatory cell infiltrate has an impact on chronic renal inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting that renal Ly6Chi proinflammatory MO/MΦs have profibrotic effects. Our findings that C5aR1-/- deficiency specifically reduced the population of Ly6Chi proinflammatory MO/MΦs following renal infection suggest that C5a/C5aR1 could contribute to the development of renal fibrosis by modulating the phenotype of infiltrating leukocytes.\\n\\nIntrarenal gene expression profiles from this study revealed that absence of C5aR1 not only reduced the expression of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors and mesenchymal markers but also led to increased expression of hepatocyte growth factor and collagen IV following renal infection. Hepatocyte growth factor was suggested as an important antifibrotic factor in renal fibrosis, promoting renal cell survival, proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis and directly antagonizing the profibrotic actions of transforming growth factor-β.35 Although the role for collagen IV in renal fibrosis is not well defined, upregulation of intrarenal expression of collagen IV mRNA was found to be associated with reduced renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction model,36 thus supporting an antifibrotic role for collagen IV in renal fibrosis. Our finding that C5aR1 has opposing effects on renal expression of profibrogenic and antifibrogenic factors supports the concept that C5aR1 influences the dynamic balance between tissue destruction and repair after renal infection, favoring the promotion of tissue destruction and impairing the repair process.\\n\\nTo conclude, this study is the first to define a novel and important role of C5aR1 in the pathogenesis of experimental chronic pyelonephritis. It also suggests that C5aR1-dependent enhancement of UPEC colonization of renal tract epithelium and excessive local inflammatory responses, as well as impairment of phagocytic function of phagocytes, contribute to the chronic inflammation and renal fibrosis. Our observation that blocking the C5a/C5aR1 axis curtailed the pathology suggests a therapeutic potential for targeting C5aR1 in chronic kidney infection. Although antibiotics can be used to treat the UTI, there is the emerging threat of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in urology in addition to the well-known frequent recurrence and persistence of infection. Targeting the C5a/C5aR1 axis may offer alternative or combination therapies to reduce the use of antibiotics.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\n\\nMice\\n\\nHomozygous C5aR1-/- mice were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells37 and backcrossed onto the C576BL/6 (H-2b) parental strain for at least 12 generations. C5aR1-/- mice and their WT littermates were used in all experiments, and animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the Animals Scientific Procedures Act\\xa01986.\\n\\n\\nInduction of chronic pyelonephritis\\n\\nA previously described model of ascending UTI leading to chronic pyelonephritis was used. The infection was induced in WT and C5aR1-/- mice (females 8–10 weeks old) by bladder inoculation of the human UPEC strain IH11128 (108 CFUs in 50 μl phosphate-buffered sailine) per urethram. The IH11128 strain (075:K5:H–) was isolated from patients with chronic pyelonephritis. It is a mannose-resistant strain expressing both Dr and type 1 fimbriae but lacking P fimbriae and hemolytic activity (a kind gift from Dr. B. Nowicki, University of Texas, Galveston, Texas, USA).38 Mice were killed at day 2, day 14, and day 56 after infection for evaluating bacterial load and renal histopathology. In some experiments, tetrarhodamine isothiocyanate–labeled IH11128 was used for imaging bacteria in kidney sections. For C5aR1 antagonist treatment experiments, WT mice were administered C5aR1 peptide antagonist (PMX53, Ac-Phe-cyclo[Orn-Pro-dCha-Trp-Arg]) or control agent (random sequence peptide) (synthesized by GenScript, Shanghai, China) by subcutaneous injection (1 mg/kg daily) starting at different stages of infection and for different times.\\n\\n\\nAssessment of renal histopathological features\\n\\nParaffin sections (4 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid–Schiff stain, or Sirius red. Stained kidney sections were scanned with a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0 HT slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamtsu, Japan) and viewed using NDP.view2 software. Renal histopathological changes were assessed on periodic acid–Schiff– and hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections using a 6-point scale in which 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 indicated normal, very little, very mild, mild, moderate, and severe histological lesions, respectively. The assessment was based on histopathological changes (i.e., cellular infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial inflammation) that were mainly located at the corticomedullary junction area. Renal fibrosis was assessed on Sirius red–stained sections. The positively stained areas were quantified by imaging analysis (ImageJ software; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Briefly, 6 to 8 corticomedullary junction viewing fields selected from appropriate areas within each kidney were examined. Positively stained areas were expressed as a percentage of the whole field area (1.92 mm2). All the aforementioned quantitative analyses were performed in a blinded fashion by 2 experienced persons.\\n\\n\\nMeasurement of bacterial load in the kidney and bladder\\n\\nTotal bacterial load in kidney and bladder tissue was measured by the agar plate assay as previously described, with modifications.26 In brief, the tissue was weighed and subsequently homogenized in 2 ml (for the kidney) or 1 ml (for the bladder) of phosphate-buffered saline. A quantity of 100 μl of a series dilution of homogenates were plated on cysteine-, lactose-, and electrolyte-deficient plates. After incubation of the plates for 24 hours, bacterial CFUs on the agar plates were manually counted and expressed as CFU per gram of tissue.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nData are shown either as the mean ± SEM or the readout of individual mice. Unpaired Student’s t test was used for comparison between two groups. All the analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism Software version 5 (GraphPad Software, LaJolla, CA, USA).\\n\\n\\nDisclosure\\n\\nAll the authors declared no competing interests.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'The complement factor 5a receptor 1 has a pathogenic role in chronic inflammation and renal fibrosis in a murine model of chronic pyelonephritis', 'journal_title': 'Kidney International'}\n",

Previous studies have shown only &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; agreement between pathologists in grading breast cancer tumour specimens. We analyse a large but incomplete data-set consisting of 24177 grades, on a discrete 1&#x02013;3 scale, provided by 732 pathologists for 52 samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We review existing methods for analysing inter-rater agreement for multiple raters and demonstrate two further methods. Firstly, we examine a simple non-chance-corrected agreement score based on the observed proportion of agreements with the consensus for each sample, which makes no allowance for missing data. Secondly, treating grades as lying on a continuous scale representing tumour severity, we use a Bayesian latent trait method to model cumulative probabilities of assigning grade values as functions of the severity and clarity of the tumour and of rater-specific parameters representing boundaries between grades 1&#x02013;2 and 2&#x02013;3. We simulate from the fitted model to estimate, for each rater, the probability of agreement with the majority. Both methods suggest that there are differences between raters in terms of rating behaviour, most often caused by consistent over- or under-estimation of the grade boundaries, and also considerable variability in the distribution of grades assigned to many individual samples. The Bayesian model addresses the tendency of the agreement score to be biased upwards for raters who, by chance, see a relatively &#x02018;easy&#x02019; set of samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Latent trait models can be adapted to provide novel information about the nature of inter-rater agreement when the number of raters is large and there are missing data. In this large study there is substantial variability between pathologists and uncertainty in the identity of the &#x02018;true&#x02019; grade of many of the breast cancer tumours, a fact often ignored in clinical studies.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count=\"12\"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id=\"s1\"><title>Introduction</title><sec id=\"s1a\"><title>Background</title><p>The problem of assessing agreement between two or more assessors, or raters, is ubiquitous in medical research. Some of the many examples can be found in the fields of radiology, epidemiology, diagnostic medicine and oncology <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Nelson1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[1]</xref>.</p><p>The problem can be split into two broad categories, according to the presence or absence of a &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019;, defined as an infallible method for determining the quantity of interest <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Zhou1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[2]</xref>. One might further subdivide these two cases according to whether the quantity of interest is categorical (such as the presence of absence of a disease) or continuous (such as a measurement of blood glucose levels). Ordinal quantities (such as ultrasound score, measured on a 1&#x02013;5 scale) can be treated either as a separate category, or analysed as if either categorical or continuous. The case in which a gold standard is available has been extensively studied, and appropriate statistical methods have been developed. Often, useful summary statistics such as sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values and positive and negative likelihood ratios are calculated to assess the adequacy of a diagnostic test <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Zhou1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[2]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Pepe1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[3]</xref>.</p><p>In this paper we look at a particular case of the second category, in which a gold standard measure is not available. Uebersax and Grove <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Uebersax1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref> define three basic designs used for the analysis of inter-rater agreement data of this type:</p><list list-type=\"order\"><list-item><p>The fixed panel design, in which each sample is rated by each rater.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The varying panel design, in which each sample is rated by a different set of raters. Raters are &#x02018;anonymous&#x02019;, in the sense that while it might be possible for a single rater to rate more than one sample, this event would either be unrecorded or not considered in the analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The replicate measurement design, in which samples are rated on multiple occasions by each rater.</p></list-item></list><p>In such examples the calculation of simple summary statistics such as sensitivity and specificity is not possible, but there is a large literature on alternative measures such as the Kappa coefficient <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Cohen1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[5]</xref>, whose merits have been debated at length. Although multi-rater versions of the Kappa coefficient exist, their use is not uncontroversial and they rely on a design in which each rater provides a rating for each sample <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Feinstein1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[6]</xref>. Alternative methods focus on modelling patterns of agreement, and log-linear models <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Agresti1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[7]</xref> and latent trait and latent class models <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Langeheine1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[8]</xref> have been widely used for this purpose.</p><p>We begin by reviewing the existing methods that have been used to assess inter-rater reliability for ordinal or categorical outcome variables in which there is no gold standard measure. We then develop a new, intuitive summary statistic for a motivating example, consisting of grading breast cancer tumour samples, in which the number of raters is large, and there is missing rating information (i.e. a rating is not available from each rater for each sample), our overall aim being to summarise the extent to which individual raters agree with the group of raters as a whole. We assess the suitability of this simple measure by comparing results with those from a Bayesian latent trait model for an ordered categorical response, and conclude by summarising the usefulness of the two methods in the analysis of this particular type of agreement data.</p></sec><sec id=\"s1b\"><title>Motivating Example</title><p>Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease and is highly variable in shape, size and character. However, a substantial amount of useful prognostic information is available from the careful histopathological examination of routine breast carcinoma specimens <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Galea1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[9]</xref>. One of the most fundamental aspects of oncological pathology, which has undoubtedly stood the test of time, has been the recognition that the detailed morphological structure of tumours, i.e. histological grade, is strongly related to their degree of malignancy. In 1928, Patey and Scarff determined that only three factors &#x02013; tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromatism &#x02013; were of importance in breast cancer grading <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Patey1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[10]</xref>. Their method has formed the basis of all subsequent grading systems.</p><p>The Nottingham method, outlined in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"pone-0002925-t001\">Table 1</xref>, is the most widely used method and overall grade is assigned as follows: Grade 1 - well differentiated - 3&#x02013;5 points, Grade 2 - moderately differentiated - 6&#x02013;7 points, Grade 3 - poorly differentiated - 8&#x02013;9 points. It has been validated through long-term follow up of over 3000 patients confirming conclusively the highly significant relationship between histological grade and prognosis; survival worsens with increasing grade <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Elston1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[11]</xref>. The method has now been adopted for use in the pathological data-set of the United Kingdom National Health Service Breast Screening Programme <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Hartman1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[12]</xref> and in the USA and Europe.</p><table-wrap id=\"pone-0002925-t001\" position=\"float\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.1371/journal.pone.0002925.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of the semi-quantitative method for assessing histological grade in breast carcinoma.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id=\"pone-0002925-t001-1\" xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.t001\"/><table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><colgroup span=\"1\"><col align=\"left\" span=\"1\"/><col align=\"center\" span=\"1\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Feature</td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Score</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\">\\n<bold>Tubule formation</bold>\\n</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Majority of tumour (&#x0003e;75&#x00025;)</td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Moderate degree (10&#x02013;75&#x00025;)</td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Little or none (&#x0003c;10&#x00025;)</td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\">\\n<bold>Nuclear pleomorphism</bold>\\n</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Small, regular uniform cells</td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Moderate increase in size and variability</td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Marked variation</td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\">\\n<bold>Mitotic counts</bold>\\n</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Dependent on microscope field area</td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1&#x02013;3</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>The perceived poor reproducibility and consistency of grading systems has been improved by use of semi-objective scoring systems and adherence to written criteria such as those provided by the Nottingham method <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Ellis1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[13]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Ellis2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[14]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-National1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[15]</xref>, but these studies have highlighted the need for grading to be carried out by trained histopathologists who work to an agreed protocol. A number of previous authors have found &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; agreement between pathologists in this regard <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Robbins1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[16]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Meyer1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[17]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Ellis3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[18]</xref>, and these conclusions are typically based on studies that use a small number of pathologists and simple methods of statistical analysis such as the Kappa coefficient. We aim to test these findings using a much larger data-set than those previously reported in the published literature.</p><p>Our data-set consists of grades provided by 732 pathologists (hereafter termed &#x02018;raters&#x02019;) for histological tissue sections from 52 breast cancer tumour samples (hereafter termed &#x02018;samples&#x02019;) circulated between 2001 and 2004, in eight twice-yearly batches. Not every rater was sent all of the samples, but raters gave grades to an average of 33 of the 52 samples (range 2 to 52 samples, interquartile range 20 to 47 samples). In the terminology of Uebersax and Grove <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Uebersax1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref>, our example provides a variation on the varying panel design. Samples are rated by different sets of raters, assumed to have been chosen at random so as to be representative of the underlying population of raters, but we term the raters as &#x02018;onymous&#x02019;, in the sense that which ratings belonged to which rater can be identified in all of the samples (although in our example the identity of the raters is not disclosed).</p><p>1367 of the 25544 individual samples submitted to raters for grading (9&#x00025;) were returned either ungraded or as &#x02018;not assessable&#x02019;. These instances have been removed from the data-set and are therefore treated as missing data in the same manner as samples that were not sent to raters. Each sample was graded by between 390 (53&#x00025;) and 513 (70&#x00025;) raters, which leaves around 36&#x00025; of all sample-rater pairs that were ungraded and that are regarded as missing data. The primary aims of the project are to provide information concerning the extent of inter-rater agreement in assigning grades to samples, and to ascertain whether there is any evidence that some raters consistently give values different to the majority. This might be the case if, for example, raters were to interpret aspects of the grading scale and guidelines in different ways.</p><p>Observed marginal data from an illustrative selection of samples

Further details of the computation of the Kappa coefficient are given by Siegel and Castellan <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Siegel1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[19]</xref>.</p><p>There are a large number of papers both advocating and criticising the use of the Kappa coefficient for assessing inter-rater agreement. Briefly, the main criticisms are that its interpretation is often based on somewhat arbitrary guideline values, leading to problems of interpretation; that it is heavily dependent on observed marginal proportions and thus the case-mix of the samples used; that it can be severely misleading in degenerate cases in which one or more of the outcome categories is uncommon; and that it lacks natural extensions when there is more than one outcome of interest or when multiple raters are used <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Feinstein1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[6]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Landis1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[20]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Fleiss1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[21]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Cicchetti1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[22]</xref>. Other chance-corrected measures have also come in for criticism <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-GuggenmoosHolzmann1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[23]</xref>. Weighted versions of the Kappa coefficient exist for the case of multiple, ordered categories <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Cohen2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[24]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Landis2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[25]</xref>, but interpretation is clouded further by an often arbitrary choice of weights for each category. In the context of the breast cancer tumour data, there are additional complications: there is a large number of raters, and an onymous varying panel design, whereas the Kappa coefficient requires a fixed panel design.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2a2\"><title>Latent trait and latent class modelling</title><p>Latent trait and latent class modelling have become increasingly popular in recent years for analysing inter-rater agreement data. Summaries are provided by Langeheine and Rost <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Langeheine1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[8]</xref> and a recent review journal edition <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Skrondal1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[26]</xref>. In the latent trait model, it is assumed that there exists an unobserved, or latent, continuous variable that represents key properties of each sample being rated. In the classical framework, a distributional form of latent trait levels is assumed for each group of samples (for example, for tumour samples with true grades 1, 2 and 3, or for disease cases and controls). Typically, both the parameters that characterise these distributions, and thresholds by which raters transform the latent variables into observed ratings, are estimated by maximum likelihood <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Uebersax1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref>. We discuss further details of the latent trait model later.</p><p>In latent class modelling, samples are regarded as belonging to exactly one of <italic>c</italic> unobserved categories, and conditional probabilities of a sample being assigned each particular rating value, given its latent class, are estimated. Often the appropriate choice of <italic>c</italic> is unknown in advance, and is estimated, or models with different values of <italic>c</italic> are compared <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Formann1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[27]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Yang1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Although latent trait models have received some criticism because the underlying trait variable lies on an arbitrary, uninterpretable scale <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Nelson1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[1]</xref>, other authors have shown how estimated parameters are related to familiar summary statistics such as sensitivity, specificity and predictive values <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Formann1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[27]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Uebersax2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[29]</xref>. Models of this type have consequently been used in a number of different applications, including inter-rater agreement <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Agresti2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[30]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Uebersax3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[31]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2a3\"><title>Other methods</title><p>One major class of models that has been used for agreement data is that of log-linear models for categorical data, as described by Agresti <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Agresti1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[7]</xref>. Originally developed from quasi-symmetry models for pairs of raters, these models have been adapted to produce a global measure of agreement for multiple raters <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Rogel1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[32]</xref>. Typically such models provide a means of assessing departure of observed data from the diagonals of either multiple two-dimensional contingency tables, or a single high-dimensional table, with parameters estimated directly by maximisation of the likelihood function. While feasible for small numbers of raters, this procedure quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of raters increases - for example, the exceedingly sparse single contingency table representing the breast cancer tumour data would have dimension 3<sup>732</sup>.</p><p>Other summary statistics that have been proposed include Yule\\'s <italic>Y</italic>, the odds ratio and the Phi coefficient, whose relative merits are discussed by Feinstein and Cicchetti <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Feinstein1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[6]</xref>, and Cicchetti and Feinstein <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Cicchetti1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[22]</xref>. Martin Andres and Femia Marzo suggest an alternative chance-corrected coefficient, Delta <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-MartinAndres1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[33]</xref>. These methods all require a fixed panel design. Landis and Koch <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Landis3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[34]</xref> propose a method based on variance partitioning in which agreement is summarised using intra- and inter-rater correlation coefficients. For the varying panel design, James <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-James1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[35]</xref> suggests an &#x02018;impartiality index&#x02019; as a means to identify categories in which there occur a higher proportion of disagreements than expected given the marginal proportions for each category. Altaye et al. <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Altaye1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[36]</xref> give maximum likelihood estimates for relevant parameters in the fixed panel multi-rater agreement problem, although the computation of these maximum likelihood estimates is infeasible if the number of raters is large or if rating data are sparse. Nelson and Pepe <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Nelson1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[1]</xref> provide a novel graphical display as a means for preliminary analysis for fixed panel data (a three-dimensional plot illustrating how the marginal proportions of the response categories vary according to the average response category across all raters). A potential limitation of this method is the clear dependence between the plotted quantities, and the consequent difficulty in interpretation.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"s2b\"><title>Proposed methods</title><p>We use the breast cancer tumour data to demonstrate and compare two methods for analysing agreement data with a large number of raters and an onymous varying panel design.

Then the contribution of sample <italic>i</italic> to the agreement score of rater <italic>j</italic> (<italic>j</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1,&#x02026;,732), is<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.e003.jpg\" mimetype=\"image\" position=\"float\"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>The contribution is zero if <italic>j</italic> does not give a rating to <italic>i</italic>, and the agreement score of <italic>j</italic> is estimated as <disp-formula><graphic xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.e004.jpg\" mimetype=\"image\" position=\"float\"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>Our initial assumptions are that different samples are independent and that in the case of incomplete rating data no information can be gleaned from the pattern of missing data (i.e. that there is no preferential selection of which samples are allocated to or returned by the various raters). In the special case that each rater gives a rating to each sample (the fixed panel design) and the further null assumption that all <italic>R</italic> raters are equally proficient, we can regard the distribution of the total number of raters, say (<italic>Y</italic>\\n<sub>1</sub>,<italic>Y</italic>\\n<sub>2</sub>,<italic>Y</italic>\\n<sub>3</sub>), assigning grades 1, 2 and 3 respectively to a given sample <italic>i</italic> as a realisation of a Multinomial (<italic>R</italic>; <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>\\n<sub>,1</sub>, <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>\\n<sub>,2</sub>, <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>\\n<sub>,3</sub>) random variable, where <italic>p<sub>i,g</sub></italic> denotes the probability of a randomly-chosen rater giving grade <italic>g</italic> to sample <italic>i</italic>.</p><p>Then for any rater <italic>j</italic>, we have from standard properties of the multinomial distribution that<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.e005.jpg\" mimetype=\"image\" position=\"float\"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>and<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.e006.jpg\" mimetype=\"image\" position=\"float\"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>\\n<italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic> can be regarded as an estimator of the overall proportion of raters that will agree with a given rater <italic>j</italic> on the grade of a randomly-chosen sample. Possible values of <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic> therefore range from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating that there was unilateral agreement on grade for every sample, and a value of 0 indicating that a particular rater did not give the same grade as any other rater for any sample. Under the null hypothesis, the minimum possible value of <italic>E</italic>(<italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic>) is 1/3, occurring only in the highly unlikely case that <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>\\n<sub>,1</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>\\n<sub>,2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>\\n<sub>,3</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1/3 for each sample <italic>i</italic>. Note that the agreement score depends on the nature of the tumour samples being rated, so, as for most studies of inter-rater agreement, comparison between studies with differing case-mixes of tumour samples requires care.</p><p>Importantly, neither the mean nor the variance of the agreement score depends on the number of raters who rate each sample, which enables a fair comparison of agreement scores between raters to be made in the presence of incomplete rating data. In practice the <italic>p<sub>i,g</sub></italic> in (3) and (4) will be unknown, and will be replaced by maximum likelihood estimates. It should also be noted that, for two different raters <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic>, agreement scores <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic> and <italic>s<sub>k</sub></italic> are not independent: there is a small positive covariance between <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic> and <italic>s<sub>k</sub></italic> that has a negligible impact for large sample sizes. From (4), the sampling variance of the agreement score of a given rater decreases with the number of samples graded by the rater, a key factor in the interpretation of the agreement score. In order to assess the level of evidence for the hypothesis that not all raters interpret the grading scale in the same way, we consider a graph similar to a funnel plot <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Spiegelhalter1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[37]</xref>, in which we add upper and lower confidence &#x02018;envelopes&#x02019; calculated by simulation under the null assumption that <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>\\n<sub>,1</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>p</italic>\\n<sub>1</sub>, <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>\\n<sub>,2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>p</italic>\\n<sub>2</sub> and <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>\\n<sub>,3</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>p</italic>\\n<sub>3</sub> for each rater <italic>i</italic>.

The upper and lower confidence envelopes can be added to a plot of agreement score against number of samples graded, and used to indicate raters who behave anomalously compared with the majority. While we draw an analogy between the resulting plot and the funnel plot used in other contexts, the two differ in the sense that there is no pre-defined tolerance limit to which we compare scores of individual pathologists: such a limit would depend on the case-mix of tumour samples used. Also, note that the envelopes are not independent of the observed data, but are intended simply to give a visual indication of how the variability of the agreement score changes with the number of samples rated.</p></sec><sec id=\"s2b2\"><title>Bayesian latent trait model</title><p>Using a Bayesian formulation of the problem enables relevant parameters to be estimated without recourse to maximising the likelihood function directly <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Uebersax1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref>, which would be impractical for our application given the large number of raters and incomplete data structure.</p><p>We think of the categorical response variable as representing an underlying, latent, scale (c.f. the &#x02018;Bones&#x02019; example in <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Spiegelhalter2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[38]</xref>) indicative of the severity of the tumour.

Consider a bipartite graph with nodes representing samples and raters, in which edges connect raters to the samples they saw.

The graph for this data-set is 2-connected, thus ensuring parameter identifiability.</p><p>Finally, we can obtain new, simulated, sets of rater/tumour observations by repeatedly sampling from the fitted Bayesian model. For each set of simulations, we record the number of raters assigning grades 1, 2 and 3 to each tumour and the majority grade for each tumour.

The four quadrants of the graph indicate four types of rater behaviour in tumour classification. The panel to the left of the graph shows in detail, for one rater in each quadrant, the estimated probability of the rater agreeing with the majority for each sample, where the samples have been ordered by their estimated severity. As already noted, rater 156 tends to under-estimate grades compared to the majority, while rater 143 tends to over-estimate. Rater 247, with a low 1&#x02013;2 boundary and a high 2&#x02013;3 boundary, tends to assign many grade 2s, while rater 275, with a high 1&#x02013;2 boundary and a low 2&#x02013;3 boundary, tends to assign few grade 2s. The elliptical nature of this plot, with a preponderance of points in the first and third quadrants, suggests that relative over- or under-estimation of the grade boundaries are the most common patterns that leads to disagreement between raters.

It can therefore be regarded as a measure of the relative agreement between an individual rater and a population of raters. For our data, we found strong evidence that there were certain raters whose levels of agreement with the majority were worse than would be expected by chance. There was no evidence that there were raters who were better than chance, perhaps unsurprisingly - it is easier to envisage reasons why a single rater might record an unusually low score than an unusually high one.</p><p>Although the agreement score is dependent on the case-mix of the samples used in a particular study, it has a straightforward interpretation as the probability that a given rater will agree with another randomly-chosen rater on a randomly-chosen sample, and can be displayed graphically in a way that avoids misleading rankings. This may be a useful tool in the preliminary analysis of data of this type, and can be used to identify potentially discrepant raters as a first step in determining possible reasons why they may differ from the majority.</p><p>We have demonstrated, using the Bayesian latent trait model, a way by which to estimate both the performance of raters, via estimated grade boundary parameters, and the marginal distributions of ratings given to each sample. The agreement score for particular raters may be misleading for raters who, by chance or otherwise, have only rated a selection of samples that are unusually easy or difficult to classify. In particular, we have shown that raters who rated &#x02018;easy&#x02019; samples tend to have unjustifiably high values of the agreement score. We therefore believe that the latent trait method is of particular value if there is missing rating information and the number of raters is large, in which case the probability that some raters will see an unusually difficult or easy set of samples is increased.</p><p>In future work the method might also be developed to relax the assumption that missing rating information is uninformative, i.e. to test whether there was any preference on the part of the raters over which samples they chose to rate. For our example, this might occur if the pattern of missing data were related to the grade. The 9&#x00025; of samples that were not rated most often occurred in groups of consecutively-numbered samples in single batches sent to certain individual raters, which in our opinion suggests that deliberate preferential rating is unlikely. In other extensions of the work, the method might be adapted for use with multivariate outcomes (e.g. to analyse the three components that constitute the grade), for ongoing rater assessment, and to deal with changes in rater behaviour or agreement over time (e.g. rater learning, or to check the impact of new grading guidelines). We do not anticipate that our proposed methods, designed for the case in which the number of raters is large, will be useful or even viable in small studies: much previous work has focussed on methods of analysis with fewer than ten raters (e.g. <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Pepe1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[3]</xref>). However, the precise extent to which the preferred methodology depends on the number of contributing raters also remains an open question.</p><p>Latent trait models have attracted some criticism because of the lack of interpretability of model parameters, owing to the arbitrary choice of latent scale <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Nelson1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[1]</xref>. However, by simulating from the posterior distributions of all parameters it is possible to provide estimates of directly interpretables1 quantities such as the probability that a rater will agree with the modal class. The method illuminates features of the raters\\' patterns of behaviour that would have not become apparent from a single-number summary such as the agreement score, a point that has also been noted with regard to the Kappa coefficient <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Rogel1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[32]</xref>. In the example considered in this paper, both the number of raters and the proportion of missing data were large, and therefore to find a model that could be fitted within the limits of computational feasibility was an important consideration.</p><p>Simulation enables ranks of raters, with plausible confidence limits, to be estimated, which could in principle be reported back to individuals. The wide confidence limits in our example, however, are illustrative of the great difficulty involved in estimating ranks precisely. Even with greater precision the practical value of knowing one\\'s rank would be limited. Conversely, knowledge of the location of one\\'s grade boundaries relative to other pathologists would be of potential interest and these measures require much less computation to obtain estimates than do the other results.</p><p>In the context of breast cancer tumour grading, our data show substantial variation between individual pathologists in the way in which grades are assigned to samples. This finding is broadly consistent with the existing literature: for example, Meyer et al. suggest that this is because &#x02018;the level of agreement achievable is limited by the subjectivity of grading criteria&#x02019; <xref rid=\"pone.0002925-Meyer1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[17]</xref>. This may have implications for clinical studies that treat grade as known on the basis of information given by just one or two raters - in many such cases the uncertainty associated with the &#x02018;true&#x02019; grade may be too large to be overlooked. In summary, our modelling approach leads to richer conclusions than simple summary statistics can provide: for example, the most frequent source of discrepancies between raters appears to be due to consistent over- or under-estimation of the grade boundaries.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"supplementary-material\" id=\"s5\"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0002925.s001\"><label>Statistical analysis file S1</label><caption><p>Code used in the statistical analysis</p><p>(0.02 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.s001.txt\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0002925.s002\"><label>Statistical analysis file S2</label><caption><p>Code used in the statistical analysis</p><p>(0.01 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.s002.txt\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0002925.s003\"><label>Statistical analysis file S3</label><caption><p>Code used in the statistical analysis</p><p>(0.01 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.s003.txt\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0002925.s004\"><label>Statistical analysis file S4</label><caption><p>Code used in the statistical analysis</p><p>(0.01 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.s004.txt\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0002925.s005\"><label>Statistical analysis file S5</label><caption><p>Code used in the statistical analysis</p><p>(0.01 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.s005.txt\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0002925.s006\"><label>Statistical analysis file S6</label><caption><p>Code used in the statistical analysis</p><p>(0.01 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.s006.txt\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0002925.s007\"><label>Statistical analysis file S7</label><caption><p>Code used in the statistical analysis</p><p>(0.01 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.s007.txt\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0002925.s008\"><label>Statistical analysis file S8</label><caption><p>Code used in the statistical analysis</p><p>(0.01 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0002925.s008.txt\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>AGL thanks colleagues at the CR-UK Cambridge Research Institute for helpful comments and suggestions.

\"\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThe problem of assessing agreement between two or more assessors, or raters, is ubiquitous in medical research. Some of the many examples can be found in the fields of radiology, epidemiology, diagnostic medicine and oncology [1].\\n\\nThe problem can be split into two broad categories, according to the presence or absence of a ‘gold standard’, defined as an infallible method for determining the quantity of interest [2]. One might further subdivide these two cases according to whether the quantity of interest is categorical (such as the presence of absence of a disease) or continuous (such as a measurement of blood glucose levels). Ordinal quantities (such as ultrasound score, measured on a 1–5 scale) can be treated either as a separate category, or analysed as if either categorical or continuous. The case in which a gold standard is available has been extensively studied, and appropriate statistical methods have been developed. Often, useful summary statistics such as sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values and positive and negative likelihood ratios are calculated to assess the adequacy of a diagnostic test [2], [3].\\n\\nIn this paper we look at a particular case of the second category, in which a gold standard measure is not available. Uebersax and Grove [4] define three basic designs used for the analysis of inter-rater agreement data of this type:\\n\\nThe fixed panel design, in which each sample is rated by each rater.\\n\\nThe varying panel design, in which each sample is rated by a different set of raters. Raters are ‘anonymous’, in the sense that while it might be possible for a single rater to rate more than one sample, this event would either be unrecorded or not considered in the analysis.\\n\\nThe replicate measurement design, in which samples are rated on multiple occasions by each rater.\\n\\nIn such examples the calculation of simple summary statistics such as sensitivity and specificity is not possible, but there is a large literature on alternative measures such as the Kappa coefficient [5], whose merits have been debated at length. Although multi-rater versions of the Kappa coefficient exist, their use is not uncontroversial and they rely on a design in which each rater provides a rating for each sample [6]. Alternative methods focus on modelling patterns of agreement, and log-linear models [7] and latent trait and latent class models [8] have been widely used for this purpose.\\n\\nWe begin by reviewing the existing methods that have been used to assess inter-rater reliability for ordinal or categorical outcome variables in which there is no gold standard measure. We then develop a new, intuitive summary statistic for a motivating example, consisting of grading breast cancer tumour samples, in which the number of raters is large, and there is missing rating information (i.e. a rating is not available from each rater for each sample), our overall aim being to summarise the extent to which individual raters agree with the group of raters as a whole. We assess the suitability of this simple measure by comparing results with those from a Bayesian latent trait model for an ordered categorical response, and conclude by summarising the usefulness of the two methods in the analysis of this particular type of agreement data.\\n\\n\\nMotivating Example\\n\\nBreast cancer is a heterogenous disease and is highly variable in shape, size and character. However, a substantial amount of useful prognostic information is available from the careful histopathological examination of routine breast carcinoma specimens [9]. One of the most fundamental aspects of oncological pathology, which has undoubtedly stood the test of time, has been the recognition that the detailed morphological structure of tumours, i.e. histological grade, is strongly related to their degree of malignancy. In 1928, Patey and Scarff determined that only three factors – tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromatism – were of importance in breast cancer grading [10]. Their method has formed the basis of all subsequent grading systems.\\n\\nThe Nottingham method, outlined in Table 1, is the most widely used method and overall grade is assigned as follows: Grade 1 - well differentiated - 3–5 points, Grade 2 - moderately differentiated - 6–7 points, Grade 3 - poorly differentiated - 8–9 points. It has been validated through long-term follow up of over 3000 patients confirming conclusively the highly significant relationship between histological grade and prognosis; survival worsens with increasing grade [11]. The method has now been adopted for use in the pathological data-set of the United Kingdom National Health Service Breast Screening Programme [12] and in the USA and Europe.\\n\\nTable 1\\nFeature\\tScore\\nTubule formation\\nMajority of tumour (>75%)\\t1\\nModerate degree (10–75%)\\t2\\nLittle or none (<10%)\\t3\\nNuclear pleomorphism\\nSmall, regular uniform cells\\t1\\nModerate increase in size and variability\\t2\\nMarked variation\\t3\\nMitotic counts\\nDependent on microscope field area\\t1–3\\n\\nThe perceived poor reproducibility and consistency of grading systems has been improved by use of semi-objective scoring systems and adherence to written criteria such as those provided by the Nottingham method [13], [14], [15], but these studies have highlighted the need for grading to be carried out by trained histopathologists who work to an agreed protocol. A number of previous authors have found ‘moderate’ agreement between pathologists in this regard [16], [17], [18], and these conclusions are typically based on studies that use a small number of pathologists and simple methods of statistical analysis such as the Kappa coefficient. We aim to test these findings using a much larger data-set than those previously reported in the published literature.\\n\\nOur data-set consists of grades provided by 732 pathologists (hereafter termed ‘raters’) for histological tissue sections from 52 breast cancer tumour samples (hereafter termed ‘samples’) circulated between 2001 and 2004, in eight twice-yearly batches. Not every rater was sent all of the samples, but raters gave grades to an average of 33 of the 52 samples (range 2 to 52 samples, interquartile range 20 to 47 samples). In the terminology of Uebersax and Grove [4], our example provides a variation on the varying panel design. Samples are rated by different sets of raters, assumed to have been chosen at random so as to be representative of the underlying population of raters, but we term the raters as ‘onymous’, in the sense that which ratings belonged to which rater can be identified in all of the samples (although in our example the identity of the raters is not disclosed).\\n\\n1367 of the 25544 individual samples submitted to raters for grading (9%) were returned either ungraded or as ‘not assessable’. These instances have been removed from the data-set and are therefore treated as missing data in the same manner as samples that were not sent to raters. Each sample was graded by between 390 (53%) and 513 (70%) raters, which leaves around 36% of all sample-rater pairs that were ungraded and that are regarded as missing data. The primary aims of the project are to provide information concerning the extent of inter-rater agreement in assigning grades to samples, and to ascertain whether there is any evidence that some raters consistently give values different to the majority. This might be the case if, for example, raters were to interpret aspects of the grading scale and guidelines in different ways.\\n\\nObserved marginal data from an illustrative selection of samples and raters are shown in the first five columns of Tables 2 and 3 respectively. Table 3 gives some indication of the extent of the variability between raters in the distribution of grades that they assign, some raters appearing, superficially, to have a greater tendency to give high grades than others.\\n\\nTable 2\\nSample\\tObserved : n (%)\\tSimulated : %\\tEstimated\\nG1\\tG2\\tG3\\tUngraded\\tG1\\tG2\\tG3\\tμ\\tλ\\n1\\t386 (93.2)\\t28 (6.8)\\t0 (0)\\t318\\t93.0\\t6.7\\t0.2\\t−5.1 (0.6)\\t1.0 (0.2)\\n6\\t326 (70.1)\\t137 (29.5)\\t2 (0.4)\\t267\\t69.8\\t29.2\\t1.0\\t−3.0 (0.1)\\t1.0 (0.1)\\n52\\t223 (43.4)\\t285 (55.6)\\t5 (1.0)\\t219\\t43.2\\t56.0\\t0.8\\t−1.8 (0.1)\\t1.5 (0.1)\\n39\\t183 (39.3)\\t258 (55.3)\\t25 (5.4)\\t266\\t38.6\\t56.1\\t5.2\\t−1.4 (0.1)\\t0.9 (0.1)\\n18\\t46 (10.1)\\t393 (86.1)\\t17 (3.7)\\t276\\t10.4\\t85.5\\t4.1\\t−0.3 (0.1)\\t1.8 (0.1)\\n46\\t77 (15.6)\\t349 (70.6)\\t68 (13.8)\\t238\\t16.0\\t70.2\\t13.9\\t−0.1 (0.1)\\t1.0 (0.1)\\n43\\t23 (4.8)\\t376 (78.3)\\t81 (16.9)\\t252\\t5.5\\t77.4\\t17.1\\t0.6 (0.1)\\t1.3 (0.1)\\n48\\t6 (1.2)\\t209 (42.1)\\t282 (56.7)\\t235\\t1.2\\t41.6\\t57.2\\t2.3 (0.1)\\t1.1 (0.1)\\n8\\t1 (0.2)\\t161 (34.4)\\t306 (65.4)\\t264\\t0.6\\t33.6\\t65.8\\t2.7 (0.1)\\t1.2 (0.1)\\n13\\t0 (0)\\t4 (0.9)\\t454 (99.1)\\t274\\t0\\t1.0\\t99.0\\t6.7 (1.5)\\t1.2 (0.4)\\n\\nTable 3\\nRater\\tObserved : n (%)\\tAgreement Score\\tSimulated No. of samples in agreement with majority (s.d.)\\tEstimated\\nG1\\tG2\\tG3\\tUngraded\\tb\\tb\\n156\\t20 (65)\\t8 (26)\\t3 (10)\\t21\\t0.41\\t27.9 (3.3)\\t0.8 (0.4)\\t5.1 (0.5)\\n273\\t22 (48)\\t11 (24)\\t13 (28)\\t6\\t0.64\\t39.2 (2.9)\\t−0.6 (0.3)\\t2.6 (0.5)\\n275\\t18 (40)\\t7 (16)\\t20 (44)\\t7\\t0.73\\t41.3 (2.7)\\t−1.4 (0.3)\\t1.1 (0.4)\\n137\\t20 (39)\\t13 (25)\\t18 (35)\\t1\\t0.76\\t41.7 (2.6)\\t−1.2 (0.3)\\t2.0 (0.4)\\n247\\t5 (11)\\t28 (62)\\t12 (27)\\t7\\t0.68\\t41.0 (2.4)\\t−3.5 (0.4)\\t2.9 (0.5)\\n500\\t14 (27)\\t21 (40)\\t17 (33)\\t0\\t0.76\\t43.2 (2.5)\\t−2.1 (0.4)\\t2.2 (0.4)\\n335\\t7 (23)\\t10 (33)\\t13 (43)\\t22\\t0.72\\t42.7 (2.6)\\t−2.0 (0.4)\\t1.8 (0.5)\\n617\\t13 (26)\\t24 (48)\\t2\\t0.73\\t41.5 (2.8)\\t−2.3 (0.4)\\t0.8 (0.4)\\n521\\t1 (6)\\t4 (25)\\t11 (69)\\t36\\t0.65\\t38.8 (3.6)\\t−3.3 (0.7)\\t0.5 (0.6)\\n143\\t0 (0)\\t11 (55)\\t9 (45)\\t32\\t0.50\\t35.7 (3.3)\\t−5.0 (0.6)\\t0.4 (0.5)\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nIn this section we discuss existing methods for analysing inter-rater agreement data, and describe two methods that we use to analyse the breast cancer tumour data.\\n\\n\\nExisting methods\\n\\n\\nThe Kappa coefficient\\n\\nOne summary statistic, the roots of which are found in the psychology literature, is particularly commonly used in papers reporting inter-rater agreement with a categorical outcome: the Kappa coefficient [5].\\n\\nThe rationale for the Kappa coefficient and other similar measures of agreement is that they are chance-corrected, in the sense that they attempt to allow for the fact that for discrete or ordinal outcomes there will be a non-zero probability pe that two raters will agree on a sample simply by guessing, thus making the observed probability of agreement po appear artificially high.\\n\\nGiven n pairs of ratings, an estimate of the true Kappa coefficient κ is given by the expressionwith approximate standard errorwhere pˆo and pˆe are estimates of the respective probabilities and n is the number of samples. Further details of the computation of the Kappa coefficient are given by Siegel and Castellan [19].\\n\\nThere are a large number of papers both advocating and criticising the use of the Kappa coefficient for assessing inter-rater agreement. Briefly, the main criticisms are that its interpretation is often based on somewhat arbitrary guideline values, leading to problems of interpretation; that it is heavily dependent on observed marginal proportions and thus the case-mix of the samples used; that it can be severely misleading in degenerate cases in which one or more of the outcome categories is uncommon; and that it lacks natural extensions when there is more than one outcome of interest or when multiple raters are used [6], [20], [21], [22]. Other chance-corrected measures have also come in for criticism [23]. Weighted versions of the Kappa coefficient exist for the case of multiple, ordered categories [24], [25], but interpretation is clouded further by an often arbitrary choice of weights for each category. In the context of the breast cancer tumour data, there are additional complications: there is a large number of raters, and an onymous varying panel design, whereas the Kappa coefficient requires a fixed panel design.\\n\\n\\nLatent trait and latent class modelling\\n\\nLatent trait and latent class modelling have become increasingly popular in recent years for analysing inter-rater agreement data. Summaries are provided by Langeheine and Rost [8] and a recent review journal edition [26]. In the latent trait model, it is assumed that there exists an unobserved, or latent, continuous variable that represents key properties of each sample being rated. In the classical framework, a distributional form of latent trait levels is assumed for each group of samples (for example, for tumour samples with true grades 1, 2 and 3, or for disease cases and controls). Typically, both the parameters that characterise these distributions, and thresholds by which raters transform the latent variables into observed ratings, are estimated by maximum likelihood [4]. We discuss further details of the latent trait model later.\\n\\nIn latent class modelling, samples are regarded as belonging to exactly one of c unobserved categories, and conditional probabilities of a sample being assigned each particular rating value, given its latent class, are estimated. Often the appropriate choice of c is unknown in advance, and is estimated, or models with different values of c are compared [27], [28].\\n\\nAlthough latent trait models have received some criticism because the underlying trait variable lies on an arbitrary, uninterpretable scale [1], other authors have shown how estimated parameters are related to familiar summary statistics such as sensitivity, specificity and predictive values [27], [29]. Models of this type have consequently been used in a number of different applications, including inter-rater agreement [30], [31].\\n\\n\\nOther methods\\n\\nOne major class of models that has been used for agreement data is that of log-linear models for categorical data, as described by Agresti [7]. Originally developed from quasi-symmetry models for pairs of raters, these models have been adapted to produce a global measure of agreement for multiple raters [32]. Typically such models provide a means of assessing departure of observed data from the diagonals of either multiple two-dimensional contingency tables, or a single high-dimensional table, with parameters estimated directly by maximisation of the likelihood function. While feasible for small numbers of raters, this procedure quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of raters increases - for example, the exceedingly sparse single contingency table representing the breast cancer tumour data would have dimension 3732.\\n\\nOther summary statistics that have been proposed include Yule's Y, the odds ratio and the Phi coefficient, whose relative merits are discussed by Feinstein and Cicchetti [6], and Cicchetti and Feinstein [22]. Martin Andres and Femia Marzo suggest an alternative chance-corrected coefficient, Delta [33]. These methods all require a fixed panel design. Landis and Koch [34] propose a method based on variance partitioning in which agreement is summarised using intra- and inter-rater correlation coefficients. For the varying panel design, James [35] suggests an ‘impartiality index’ as a means to identify categories in which there occur a higher proportion of disagreements than expected given the marginal proportions for each category. Altaye et al. [36] give maximum likelihood estimates for relevant parameters in the fixed panel multi-rater agreement problem, although the computation of these maximum likelihood estimates is infeasible if the number of raters is large or if rating data are sparse. Nelson and Pepe [1] provide a novel graphical display as a means for preliminary analysis for fixed panel data (a three-dimensional plot illustrating how the marginal proportions of the response categories vary according to the average response category across all raters). A potential limitation of this method is the clear dependence between the plotted quantities, and the consequent difficulty in interpretation.\\n\\n\\nProposed methods\\n\\nWe use the breast cancer tumour data to demonstrate and compare two methods for analysing agreement data with a large number of raters and an onymous varying panel design. Our proposed methods are designed to reflect the extent to which the distribution of ratings provided by individual raters agrees with that provided by all raters.\\n\\n\\nThe agreement score\\n\\nAn easily-computed, intuitive summary statistic is a simple agreement score sj, which can be calculated for each rater j and which is based on the marginal distribution of grades given to each sample.\\n\\nLet gij be the observed grade assigned to sample i by rater j, Nj be the number of samples given a rating by rater j, and ni,g be the observed number of raters giving grade g to sample i, for g\\u200a=\\u200a1,2,3 and i\\u200a=\\u200a1,…,m, where m\\u200a=\\u200a52 in the example. Then the contribution of sample i to the agreement score of rater j (j\\u200a=\\u200a1,…,732), is(1)The contribution is zero if j does not give a rating to i, and the agreement score of j is estimated as (2)Our initial assumptions are that different samples are independent and that in the case of incomplete rating data no information can be gleaned from the pattern of missing data (i.e. that there is no preferential selection of which samples are allocated to or returned by the various raters). In the special case that each rater gives a rating to each sample (the fixed panel design) and the further null assumption that all R raters are equally proficient, we can regard the distribution of the total number of raters, say (Y1,Y2,Y3), assigning grades 1, 2 and 3 respectively to a given sample i as a realisation of a Multinomial (R; pi,1, pi,2, pi,3) random variable, where pi,g denotes the probability of a randomly-chosen rater giving grade g to sample i.\\n\\nThen for any rater j, we have from standard properties of the multinomial distribution that(3)and(4)sj can be regarded as an estimator of the overall proportion of raters that will agree with a given rater j on the grade of a randomly-chosen sample. Possible values of sj therefore range from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating that there was unilateral agreement on grade for every sample, and a value of 0 indicating that a particular rater did not give the same grade as any other rater for any sample. Under the null hypothesis, the minimum possible value of E(sj) is 1/3, occurring only in the highly unlikely case that pi,1\\u200a=\\u200api,2\\u200a=\\u200api,3\\u200a=\\u200a1/3 for each sample i. Note that the agreement score depends on the nature of the tumour samples being rated, so, as for most studies of inter-rater agreement, comparison between studies with differing case-mixes of tumour samples requires care.\\n\\nImportantly, neither the mean nor the variance of the agreement score depends on the number of raters who rate each sample, which enables a fair comparison of agreement scores between raters to be made in the presence of incomplete rating data. In practice the pi,g in (3) and (4) will be unknown, and will be replaced by maximum likelihood estimates. It should also be noted that, for two different raters j and k, agreement scores sj and sk are not independent: there is a small positive covariance between sj and sk that has a negligible impact for large sample sizes. From (4), the sampling variance of the agreement score of a given rater decreases with the number of samples graded by the rater, a key factor in the interpretation of the agreement score. In order to assess the level of evidence for the hypothesis that not all raters interpret the grading scale in the same way, we consider a graph similar to a funnel plot [37], in which we add upper and lower confidence ‘envelopes’ calculated by simulation under the null assumption that pi,1\\u200a=\\u200ap1, pi,2\\u200a=\\u200ap2 and pi,3\\u200a=\\u200ap3 for each rater i. We use the observed marginal proportions of grades 1, 2 and 3 for each sample g as plug-in estimates of the true population proportions p1,g, p2,g and p3,g. The steps required to create such a plot are:\\n\\nFix h≤m, the number of samples graded by a hypothetical rater.\\n\\nSelect h of the 52 samples at random, say y1,…,yh.\\n\\nFor samples y1,…,yh, simulate grades g1,…,gh from the observed empirical distributions of grades given to the sample (i.e. for a given sample, with probability of selecting grade j proportional to the proportion of raters who assigned grade j to the sample).\\n\\nEstimate the agreement score based on the simulated grades g1,…,gh using (1) and (2).\\n\\nRepeat steps 2–4.\\n\\nWe can then estimate the distribution function of the agreement score based on a large number of replications for each h. The upper and lower confidence envelopes can be added to a plot of agreement score against number of samples graded, and used to indicate raters who behave anomalously compared with the majority. While we draw an analogy between the resulting plot and the funnel plot used in other contexts, the two differ in the sense that there is no pre-defined tolerance limit to which we compare scores of individual pathologists: such a limit would depend on the case-mix of tumour samples used. Also, note that the envelopes are not independent of the observed data, but are intended simply to give a visual indication of how the variability of the agreement score changes with the number of samples rated.\\n\\n\\nBayesian latent trait model\\n\\nUsing a Bayesian formulation of the problem enables relevant parameters to be estimated without recourse to maximising the likelihood function directly [4], which would be impractical for our application given the large number of raters and incomplete data structure.\\n\\nWe think of the categorical response variable as representing an underlying, latent, scale (c.f. the ‘Bones’ example in [38]) indicative of the severity of the tumour. We regard the act of a rater grading a sample as estimating its true severity as a number on the latent scale, and comparing this position with two grade boundaries that ‘separate’ grades 1 and 2, and 2 and 3 respectively. These grade boundaries are allowed to vary between raters. If rater j estimates the position of a given sample on the latent scale as xj, then he will assign grade 1 if xj<b12,j, grade 2 if b12,j<xj<b23,j and grade 3 if xj>b23,j, where b12,j and b23,j are, respectively, the lower and upper grade boundaries on the latent scale according to its interpretation by rater j.\\n\\nThis can be represented by a cumulative logit model of the formfor suitably-chosen functions f and g. We choose the following forms for f and g:Our choice of these functional forms is motivated by the fact that the parameters are easily interpretable: μi can be thought of as the latent measure of the severity of sample i, λi as the clarity of the sample (i.e. the ease with which it can be assessed), and b12,j and b23,j as the grade boundaries of rater j as described above.\\n\\nWe choose priors for the parameters as follows. We give the average of the two boundaries b12 and b23, bav say, a Normal prior with zero mean, and a hyperparameter for the inverse of the variance that itself has a Normal(0,1) distribution, truncated to be positive. We give half the distance between the two grade boundaries, , say, a Normal prior with a mean of two, truncated to be positive to constrain the b12 boundary to lie below the b23 boundary. The inverse of the variance of this prior is again a hyperparameter with a Normal(0,1) distribution truncated to be positive.\\n\\nWe give the tumour severity parameters μ a Normal prior, with both mean and variance set to be hyperparameters. We also give the hyperparameter for the inverse of the variance a Normal(0,1) distribution truncated to be positive, and that for the mean a Normal(0,4) distribution. We assign to the tumour clarity parameters λ a truncated Normal prior with mean zero and an inverse-variance hyperparameter that has a Normal(0,1) distribution truncated to be positive.\\n\\nIn order for the model to be fitted, certain conditions must hold. Consider a bipartite graph with nodes representing samples and raters, in which edges connect raters to the samples they saw. The graph must be connected in order for the parameters to be identifiable and to enable reasonable comparison between the grade boundaries of different raters. The graph for this data-set is 2-connected, thus ensuring parameter identifiability.\\n\\nFinally, we can obtain new, simulated, sets of rater/tumour observations by repeatedly sampling from the fitted Bayesian model. For each set of simulations, we record the number of raters assigning grades 1, 2 and 3 to each tumour and the majority grade for each tumour. Using data from 1250 simulations, we estimate the probability that a given rater would agree with the majority for a given tumour for each rater/tumour pair. The simulated data allow the estimation of two marginal probabilities, qj and ri say, the first giving a measure of the performance of each rater j (i.e. the probability of the rater being in the majority for a sample chosen at random) and the second giving a measure of the difficulty associated with grading each sample i (i.e. the proportion of raters giving the consensus grade for the sample).\\n\\nThe model was fitted in WinBUGS 1.4.2 [39], and other calculations were performed using R version 2.5 [40]. Code used for the analysis is available in supplementary Statistical analysis file S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8 at the journal website.

The theoretical mean agreement score given the marginal proportions for each grade for each sample using (3) is 0.73.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the funnel-type plot of the agreement scores for all raters, with 95% and 99% confidence envelopes based on 10000 replications and the median simulated agreement score added. 61 raters (8.3%) lie outside the 95% envelope, and 31 raters (4.2%) outside the 99% envelope, suggesting substantial differences between raters in the way by which grades are assigned. Note that of the raters lying outside the 99% envelope, almost all lie below the lower bound, rather than above the upper bound. We would not normally encourage using the funnel-type plot as a means of picking out individuals whose discrepancies may be attributable to chance alone, but in this example one point lies so much further from the envelope than the rest that the corresponding rater warrants further investigation: rater 156, who rated 31 samples and whose agreement score is just 0.41. We can see from Table 4 that this particular rater has a marked tendency to underestimate grades compared to the consensus value (the observed modal grade amongst all raters).\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002925.g002Figure 2 Estimated agreement score, with 95% and 99% confidence envelopes, for 732 pathologists.Plot of estimated agreement score against number of samples rated, with confidence envelopes within which 95% and 99% of raters would be expected to lie if all raters were equally proficient.\\n\\nTable 4\\nRating of rater 156\\tConsensus grade\\nG1\\tG2\\tG3\\nG1\\t8\\t12\\t0\\nG2\\t0\\t1\\t7\\nG3\\t0\\t3\\n\\n\\nBayesian latent trait model\\n\\n\\nTables 2 and 3 contain parameter estimates and results of the simulations from the fitted model. From simulation, the mean proportion assigning each grade to a given sample was very similar to the observed proportion of grades (Table 2).\\n\\nThe simulation results are summarised in Figure 3, in which the estimated probabilities of each rater agreeing with each sample's modal grade are plotted. Red values indicate low probabilities and green values high probabilities. The panel on the right-hand side of Figure 3 indicates the expected proportion of ratings assigned to each of the three grades. There are around 15 samples for which consensus on the modal grade is unclear, which naturally leads to relatively low probabilities of agreeing with the modal grade for most raters. At the other extreme, some samples were regarded almost equivocally as grades 1 or 3, while the consensus was weaker for the samples for which grade 2 was the modal value, a result also noted by other authors [18].\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002925.g003Figure 3 Summary of results of the Bayesian latent trait model.The main body of the plot is a heatmap showing the probability that raters (columns) agree with the consensus grade for each sample (rows). Raters are ordered in terms of estimated probability of agreeing with the majority, and samples in terms of estimated latent severity. The right-hand panel shows the expected distribution of assigned grades for each sample, and the bottom panel shows, for each rater, the marginal probability of agreeing with the consensus grade.\\n\\nAlthough the estimated values of the grade boundary parameters b12,j and b23,j, shown for a selection of raters in Table 3, have no direct interpretation themselves, they can be plotted to compare rating patterns of the raters relative to one another (Figure 4). The four quadrants of the graph indicate four types of rater behaviour in tumour classification. The panel to the left of the graph shows in detail, for one rater in each quadrant, the estimated probability of the rater agreeing with the majority for each sample, where the samples have been ordered by their estimated severity. As already noted, rater 156 tends to under-estimate grades compared to the majority, while rater 143 tends to over-estimate. Rater 247, with a low 1–2 boundary and a high 2–3 boundary, tends to assign many grade 2s, while rater 275, with a high 1–2 boundary and a low 2–3 boundary, tends to assign few grade 2s. The elliptical nature of this plot, with a preponderance of points in the first and third quadrants, suggests that relative over- or under-estimation of the grade boundaries are the most common patterns that leads to disagreement between raters. We note that for computational ease we implemented the model in a manner that will impart some small correlation on the relationship between b12,j and b23,j, but simulations suggest that this will not be responsible for the magnitude of correlation seen here. As indicated by Table 3, the expected number of samples for which a rater agrees with a consensus changes substantially only when a rater's rating behaviour is extremely atypical.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002925.g004Figure 4 Comparison of grade boundaries, estimated from the Bayesian latent trait model, for 732 pathologists.Scatter-plot of estimated grade boundaries from the Bayesian latent trait model, in which the estimated grade boundary b12,j is plotted against b23,j for each rater j. The left-hand panel shows the estimated probability qj of agreeing with the majority for four raters, one from each quadrant of the graph, as indicated on the main plot.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5 shows estimated ranks of each rater based on estimated qj values from 625 simulations from the fitted model, plotted with 95% confidence intervals and ordered by the point estimate of the rank. The overall impression is of very wide intervals, encompassing the majority of the range of ranks, for all but the lowest-ranked few raters. The wide intervals are a consequence of both the small number of samples seen by many raters and the well-known difficulty of estimating ranks precisely.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002925.g005Figure 5 Estimated ranks of 732 pathologists.Plot of the raters' ranks, estimated from the Bayesian latent trait model, with 95% credible limits.\\n\\n\\nComparison of the methods\\n\\nBoth the agreement score method and the Bayesian latent trait model indicate heterogeneity between raters for our data-set. We hypothesised that the agreement score method might give an unduly optimistic assessment of rater performance for raters who had seen a subset of samples that were relatively easy to grade. Therefore, in order to compare the two methods of analysis, we consider the estimated difference in raters' ranks from the two methods. We plot this against the estimate, averaged over the samples seen by each rater, of the ri (Figure 6). The clear trend verifies the anticipated result: raters who by chance saw ‘easy’ samples tend to have more favourable ranks by the agreement score method, which is rectified by the latent trait model.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002925.g006Figure 6 Comparison of the two analysis methods.Plot of differences in raters' estimated ranks for the two methods against a measure of the difficulty of the samples seen by each rater, grouped by deciles. This measure of difficulty is calculated as the average, taken over the samples seen by each rater, of the estimated values of ri.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWe have developed and compared two methods for inter-rater agreement analysis of data in which there is no gold standard, a large number of onymous raters, and incomplete rating information.\\n\\nThe agreement score is a simple, non-chance-corrected statistic that can be easily calculated and potentially used in order to provide some evidence whether there may be raters whose behaviour is discrepant compared to that of the majority. It can therefore be regarded as a measure of the relative agreement between an individual rater and a population of raters. For our data, we found strong evidence that there were certain raters whose levels of agreement with the majority were worse than would be expected by chance. There was no evidence that there were raters who were better than chance, perhaps unsurprisingly - it is easier to envisage reasons why a single rater might record an unusually low score than an unusually high one.\\n\\nAlthough the agreement score is dependent on the case-mix of the samples used in a particular study, it has a straightforward interpretation as the probability that a given rater will agree with another randomly-chosen rater on a randomly-chosen sample, and can be displayed graphically in a way that avoids misleading rankings. This may be a useful tool in the preliminary analysis of data of this type, and can be used to identify potentially discrepant raters as a first step in determining possible reasons why they may differ from the majority.\\n\\nWe have demonstrated, using the Bayesian latent trait model, a way by which to estimate both the performance of raters, via estimated grade boundary parameters, and the marginal distributions of ratings given to each sample. The agreement score for particular raters may be misleading for raters who, by chance or otherwise, have only rated a selection of samples that are unusually easy or difficult to classify. In particular, we have shown that raters who rated ‘easy’ samples tend to have unjustifiably high values of the agreement score. We therefore believe that the latent trait method is of particular value if there is missing rating information and the number of raters is large, in which case the probability that some raters will see an unusually difficult or easy set of samples is increased.\\n\\nIn future work the method might also be developed to relax the assumption that missing rating information is uninformative, i.e. to test whether there was any preference on the part of the raters over which samples they chose to rate. For our example, this might occur if the pattern of missing data were related to the grade. The 9% of samples that were not rated most often occurred in groups of consecutively-numbered samples in single batches sent to certain individual raters, which in our opinion suggests that deliberate preferential rating is unlikely. In other extensions of the work, the method might be adapted for use with multivariate outcomes (e.g. to analyse the three components that constitute the grade), for ongoing rater assessment, and to deal with changes in rater behaviour or agreement over time (e.g. rater learning, or to check the impact of new grading guidelines). We do not anticipate that our proposed methods, designed for the case in which the number of raters is large, will be useful or even viable in small studies: much previous work has focussed on methods of analysis with fewer than ten raters (e.g. [3]). However, the precise extent to which the preferred methodology depends on the number of contributing raters also remains an open question.\\n\\nLatent trait models have attracted some criticism because of the lack of interpretability of model parameters, owing to the arbitrary choice of latent scale [1]. However, by simulating from the posterior distributions of all parameters it is possible to provide estimates of directly interpretables1 quantities such as the probability that a rater will agree with the modal class. The method illuminates features of the raters' patterns of behaviour that would have not become apparent from a single-number summary such as the agreement score, a point that has also been noted with regard to the Kappa coefficient [32]. In the example considered in this paper, both the number of raters and the proportion of missing data were large, and therefore to find a model that could be fitted within the limits of computational feasibility was an important consideration.\\n\\nSimulation enables ranks of raters, with plausible confidence limits, to be estimated, which could in principle be reported back to individuals. The wide confidence limits in our example, however, are illustrative of the great difficulty involved in estimating ranks precisely. Even with greater precision the practical value of knowing one's rank would be limited. Conversely, knowledge of the location of one's grade boundaries relative to other pathologists would be of potential interest and these measures require much less computation to obtain estimates than do the other results.\\n\\nIn the context of breast cancer tumour grading, our data show substantial variation between individual pathologists in the way in which grades are assigned to samples. This finding is broadly consistent with the existing literature: for example, Meyer et al. suggest that this is because ‘the level of agreement achievable is limited by the subjectivity of grading criteria’ [17]. This may have implications for clinical studies that treat grade as known on the basis of information given by just one or two raters - in many such cases the uncertainty associated with the ‘true’ grade may be too large to be overlooked. In summary, our modelling approach leads to richer conclusions than simple summary statistics can provide: for example, the most frequent source of discrepancies between raters appears to be due to consistent over- or under-estimation of the grade boundaries.\\n\\n\\nSupporting InformationStatistical analysis file S1\\n\\nCode used in the statistical analysis\\n\\n(0.02 MB TXT)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.Statistical analysis file S2\\n\\nCode used in the statistical analysis\\n\\n(0.01 MB TXT)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.Statistical analysis file S3\\n\\nCode used in the statistical analysis\\n\\n(0.01 MB TXT)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.Statistical analysis file S4\\n\\nCode used in the statistical analysis\\n\\n(0.01 MB TXT)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.Statistical analysis file S5\\n\\nCode used in the statistical analysis\\n\\n(0.01 MB TXT)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.Statistical analysis file S6\\n\\nCode used in the statistical analysis\\n\\n(0.01 MB TXT)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.Statistical analysis file S7\\n\\nCode used in the statistical analysis\\n\\n(0.01 MB TXT)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.Statistical analysis file S8\\n\\nCode used in the statistical analysis\\n\\n(0.01 MB TXT)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Assessing Agreement between Multiple Raters with Missing Rating Information, Applied to Breast Cancer Tumour Grading', 'journal_title': 'PLoS ONE'}\n",

Transporting their payload to the cell nucleus would be attractive from the standpoint of maximizing both the specificity and effectiveness of tumor treatment. Our efforts to achieve these goals have been focused on nanobiotechnological creation of an artificial multifunctional transporting platform, ie, the recombinant modular nanotransporter (MNT).<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b12-ijn-7-467\">12</xref> The MNT is a modular polypeptide that can contain four moieties, ie, an internalizable ligand to provide target cell recognition and receptor-mediated endocytosis by the cell, an endosomolytic module to facilitate escape from endosomes, a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif to allow active transport into the cell nucleus via binding to cytoplasmic importins, and a carrier domain for efficient attachment of the drug (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f1-ijn-7-467\">Figure 1</xref>).

In this study, we describe the in vivo working polypeptide-based, multifunctional platform for targeted delivery of short-range highly cytotoxic therapeutics to the most vulnerable compartment of the tumor cell. We demonstrate that selective accumulation in tumors, with preferential accumulation in cancer cell nuclei but not in adjacent normal tissue, enhances the therapeutic efficacy of photosensitizers, a type of drug that requires localization within the cell nucleus to be effective. In designing a nanosized multifunctional vehicle for achieving efficient delivery to cell nuclei in cancer cells, the first objective was to optimize delivery to the tumor and the second was to facilitate intracellular transport to the nucleus. With regard to the former, the tumor uptake of, eg, nanoparticles, exploits the presence of 200&#x02013;1200 nm pores present in tumor vascular endothelium<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b30-ijn-7-467\">30</xref> via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, this generally occurs at the expense of being able to improve specificity through the addition of a receptor-addressable targeting element.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b31-ijn-7-467\">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b34-ijn-7-467\">34</xref> Instead, given that tumor permeability and extravasation increases with decreasing molecular size, we decided to assemble an artificial multifunctional device genetically with a controllable molecular weight rather than utilize a particle scaffold with multiple functional elements decorating its surface. One cannot exclude the possibility that the enhanced permeability and retention effect can play a role when MNT-photosensitizer conjugates are administered intravenously. However, it should be noted that the enhanced permeability and retention effect can also be observed with free photosensitizers; more than 90% of them are immediately taken up by different blood proteins and lipoproteins, mainly by low-density lipoproteins, highdensity lipoproteins, and albumin.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b35-ijn-7-467\">35</xref> In tumor tissue, where extracellular pH is lower than that of normal tissue, chlorin e<sub>6</sub> binds to low-density lipoproteins which are considered to be effective photosensitizer delivery vehicles,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b36-ijn-7-467\">36</xref> and significantly better than at neutral pH.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b37-ijn-7-467\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b38-ijn-7-467\">38</xref> Thus, the injected photosensitizers exist in blood mainly in a protein-bound state and their behavior is governed<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b37-ijn-7-467\">37</xref> by the macromolecules and macromolecular complexes which bind them. It has been shown that the enhanced permeability and retention effect can be observed with macromolecules having an apparent molecular size larger than 40&#x02013;800 kDa.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39-ijn-7-467\">39</xref> In comparison, the molecular weight of our MNT is approximately 70 kDa, and that of low-density lipoprotein is about 3000 kDa.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b40-ijn-7-467\">40</xref> Leunig et al,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b41-ijn-7-467\">41</xref> who investigated tumor accumulation of different porphyrin-like photosensitizers, showed that the enhanced permeability and retention effect appears to be the most probable reason for the tumor selectivity of this type of photosensitizer. Therefore, qualitatively, free photosensitizer in tumor vessels and photosensitizer transported by MNT may be considered as similar in terms of enhanced permeability and retention effect, and perhaps even more favorable for the free photosensitizer.</p><p>Selective delivery of a drug to the cell nucleus is dependent on at least three design elements, ie, a NLS, a size compatible with passage through pores in the nuclear membrane, and a means of achieving specific binding to the targeted cell population. A variety of NLS, including the one used in this study, have been shown to deliver drugs efficiently to the cell nucleus via binding to importins present in the cytoplasm.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b42-ijn-7-467\">42</xref> However, even after binding of a molecule to NLS, the size of the openings in the nuclear pore complex only increases from 8&#x02013;10 nm to about 40 nm,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b43-ijn-7-467\">43</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b44-ijn-7-467\">44</xref> restricting nuclear entry to larger carrier systems. Another limitation of NLS-mediated delivery is that it lacks tumor specificity. One approach that has been investigated to circumvent this problem is to couple multiple NLS to internalizing antibodies. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b45-ijn-7-467\">45</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b46-ijn-7-467\">46</xref> Although NLS conjugation was shown to enhance nuclear localization, the majority of the activity was found in other cellular compartments. A possible contributing factor to these observations is sequestration of the NLS-modified antibody in endosomes after receptor-mediated endocytosis, which could lead to proteolytic degradation of the conjugate and/or prevent significant interaction with nuclear transport receptors present in the cytoplasm.</p><p>For this reason, we believe that an important design element of these MNT is the provision of an endosome escape pathway, thereby increasing the probability of NLS contact with cytoplasmic importins and facilitating nuclear translocation. The translocation domain of DTox was selected for this purpose and previous studies have shown that MNT containing the DTox sequence resulted in the creation of pores in lipid bilayers at endosomal/lysosomal pH.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b16-ijn-7-467\">16</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b17-ijn-7-467\">17</xref></p><p>In vitro, it is possible to separate the two processes involved,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b16-ijn-7-467\">16</xref> ie, MNT penetration into the cell cytoplasm and subsequent MNT nuclear accumulation in the nuclei. The cells can be additionally incubated without MNT after incubation with MNT, thus permitting cytoplasmic MNT to enter into the nuclei. However, such a method cannot be used in vivo. One needs to make frozen sections in the situation where the MNT has gone from the blood pool and intercellular space to the target cells, where the MNT is presumed to pass from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm, and finally undergo translocation to the cell nuclei. Moreover, one must utilize a method with sufficient sensitivity to detect diminishing quantities of the MNT. Fortunately, such a favorable concurrence of circumstances can be seen in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f5-ijn-7-467\">Figure 5A&#x02013;C</xref>, which depicts predominantly nuclear MNT accumulation. In other cases (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f5-ijn-7-467\">Figure 5D&#x02013;F</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f5-ijn-7-467\">Figure 5G&#x02013;I</xref>), we obtained images showing that MNT is in the nuclei and also in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, all the images are consistent with nuclear targeting of MNT.</p><p>Perhaps the most relevant metric for evaluating the potential utility of MNT for transport of a drug from the blood pool to the nuclei of target cell populations is to determine the effect of MNT conjugation on the therapeutic efficacy of a drug that is cytotoxic only when localized in the cell nucleus. Although Auger electron emitting radionuclides ultimately might be the best method for eventual clinical application of MNT, they also emit other radiation with multicellular ranges. Instead, we evaluated MNT in the context of photodynamic therapy because the cytotoxic reactive oxygen species generated upon photoactivation have a radius of action of less than 0.02 &#x003bc;m and their effects in tumor tissue can be switched on and off nearly instantaneously with light of an appropriate wavelength.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b47-ijn-7-467\">47</xref> A time interval of 3 hours between photosensitizer-MNT or photosensitizer administration and tumor illumination was selected on the basis of previous studies using chlorin e<sub>6</sub> and its derivatives for photodynamic therapy<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b48-ijn-7-467\">48</xref> and our data on tumor-specific accumulation kinetics of MNT. In the three in vivo efficacy experiments, the nature of the tumor, receptor target, photosensitizer and MNT varied, and differences in therapeutic effectiveness of the photosensitizer-MNT (and also the free photosensitizer) were observed.</p><p>Treatment of melanoma by photodynamic therapy is hindered substantially by almost complete absorption of light by melanin.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b49-ijn-7-467\">49</xref> For this reason, the therapeutic efficacy of DTox-HMP-NLS-&#x003b1;MSH in the two murine melanoma models in tandem with bacteriochlorin <italic>p</italic>, a photosensitizer with an absorption peak at a wavelength (761 nm) where light penetration is better, was estimated.

Consistent with its less pigmented nature, offering the possibility of higher light penetration, longer median survivals for photosensitizer-MNT (and free photosensitizer) were seen in animals with Cloudman S91 melanoma. However, it should be noted that the average number of &#x003b1;MSH receptors on B16-F1 cells in vitro is about twice that reported for Cloudman S91 cells.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b22-ijn-7-467\">22</xref></p><p>Photodynamic therapy was also performed with chlorin e<sub>6</sub>-DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF in athymic mice with A431 human epidermoid carcinoma xenografts in order to evaluate the therapeutic response obtainable with an MNT containing a different ligand module and in a setting less compromised by light absorption.

MNT can improve specificity of drugs that ultimately can result in decreased side effects for patients, which is the main advantage and goal of nanomedicine.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b51-ijn-7-467\">51</xref> Moreover, delivery of drugs requiring nuclear transport to have a meaningful cytotoxic effect can be enhanced significantly through MNT-mediated delivery in vivo. In addition, preliminary studies suggest that MNT possess low toxicity and immunogenicity, as well as the practical advantages of being a nanoscale delivery system, including ease of production, long-term stability, and uniformity of physiochemical properties. Most of the &#x0201c;&#x02026; desired characteristics for a nanoparticle drug delivery platform &#x02026;&#x0201d;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b52-ijn-7-467\">52</xref> can be ascribed to MNT, ie, small size, stability under physiological conditions, inherently nontoxic materials and degradation products, moderate lifetime in the circulatory system (half-life about 45 minutes in mice for MNT similar to those described here; our unpublished data), a trigger mechanism for release into the hyaloplasm from acidifying endosomes, and specific cellular and subcellular targeting. Further, compared with most nanoscale delivery systems, MNT possess the essential combination of three functional modules, designed to provide step-by-step specific delivery from the surface of the target cell to its nucleus. As already mentioned, NLS, which is necessary to achieve entry of a particle/macromolecule into the interphase nucleus, can increase the size of the opening in the nuclear pore complex from only 8&#x02013;10 nm to about 40 nm, which restricts nuclear entry of larger carrier systems, including most liposomes and nanoparticles. This is one of the reasons for using MNT to achieve intranuclear delivery of drugs. Also, among the other potential advantages of MNT, one can mention their uniformity in size and composition. Finally, MNT offer the possibility of long-term storage, favorably distinguishing MNT from those nanoparticle systems that require preparation a relatively short time prior to use.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b53-ijn-7-467\">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b54-ijn-7-467\">54</xref> Finally, because of the modular nature of MNT design, one could envisage utilizing this platform to generate personalized therapeutics by tailoring the ligand and drug profiles to the characteristics of individual patients.</p><p>Supplementary data are available, including evaluation of MNT functionality after freeze drying, MNT toxicity results, in vivo <sup>125</sup>I-labeled MNT tissue distribution and tumor uptake kinetics, and an additional Materials and Methods section for delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and tumor response calculations.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"supplementary-material\"><title>Supplementary data</title><sec><title>Evaluation of MNT functionality after freeze-drying</title><p>Stability and convenience are important factors in evaluating the potential utility of a nanosystem as a platform for the development of therapeutics.

The MNT, comprising epidermal growth factor (EGF) for targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is overexpressed on several cancers, including head and neck, breast carcinoma, and glioblastoma, the optimized nuclear localization sequence from SV40 large tumor antigen (NLS), the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> hemoglobin-like protein (HMP) as a carrier module, and a translocation domain of diphtheria toxin as the endosomolytic amphipathic module (DTox) (DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF) samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8) and freeze-dried. There-after, the preparations were reconstituted by the addition of deionized water.

Specific delivery and binding to malignant cell populations can be achieved by targeting cell surface receptors that are either uniquely expressed or overexpressed on cancer cells. A variety of receptor-avid ligands have been evaluated for this purpose, either alone or affixed to nanoparticles,1,2 including antibodies3 and their fragments,4 other proteins,5 peptides,6 and aptamers. 7 After binding to the targeted receptor, the fate of the ligand-drug bioconjugate can be either to remain on the cell membrane or to be transported into the cytoplasm.8 However, the efficiency of most therapeutics depends to a large extent on their subcellular localization, and for many of them, the most vulnerable compartment is the nucleus. Furthermore, certain types of therapeutics, such as photosensitizers9 and Auger electron emitting radionuclides, 10 have ranges of action of less than 0.1 μm, which is a major advantage for minimizing damage to normal tissues adjacent to tumor tissue, but renders their cytotoxic effectiveness almost exclusively dependent on achieving delivery to the cell nucleus.11\\n\\nVehicles that efficiently deliver therapeutic agents to their locus in quo in tumor tissue engage receptors on the cancer cell surface. Transporting their payload to the cell nucleus would be attractive from the standpoint of maximizing both the specificity and effectiveness of tumor treatment. Our efforts to achieve these goals have been focused on nanobiotechnological creation of an artificial multifunctional transporting platform, ie, the recombinant modular nanotransporter (MNT).12 The MNT is a modular polypeptide that can contain four moieties, ie, an internalizable ligand to provide target cell recognition and receptor-mediated endocytosis by the cell, an endosomolytic module to facilitate escape from endosomes, a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif to allow active transport into the cell nucleus via binding to cytoplasmic importins, and a carrier domain for efficient attachment of the drug (Figure 1). In fact, MNT is an artificially generated detail of the cell transport machinery (or a nanodevice, which exploits the cell transport machinery) that was designed for cell-specific transport into a preassigned cellular compartment (the cell nucleus in this case).\\n\\nPursuing this strategy,13 we designed, produced, and characterized bacterially-expressed MNT comprising α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (αMSH) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) for targeting αMSH receptors that are overexpressed in melanoma14 or the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is overexpressed on several cancers, including head and neck, breast carcinoma, and glioblastoma, 15 the optimized nuclear localization sequence from SV40 large tumor antigen, the Escherichia coli hemoglobin-like protein (HMP) as a carrier module, and a translocation domain of diphtheria toxin as the endosomolytic amphipathic module (DTox). Having demonstrated that MNT could be produced and purified efficiently, with retention of function of each of the modules, and having shown that every module is necessary for the maximum MNT activity,12,16 we next evaluated their potential utility as a platform for targeted cancer therapy. Conjugation of the photosensitizer chlorin e6 to the MNT DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF increased cytotoxicity by a factor of more than 3000 for the EGFR-expressing A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cell line compared with free chlorin e6.16\\n\\nHerein, we investigate the in vivo characteristics of these MNT, designed to deliver photosensitizers to αMSH receptor-expressing and EGFR-expressing tumors. Evidence is provided that MNT selectively accumulates in cancer cells, with the highest concentration in the cell nuclei. Importantly, MNT-mediated delivery of photosensitizers resulted in more than 90% tumor growth inhibition and significantly prolonged survival compared with the free drug, while producing few if any side effects.\\n\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n\\n\\nSynthesis of MNT\\n\\nDTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH (70.4 kDa) and DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF (76.3 kDa) were synthesized and purified as described elsewhere.12,16 Briefly, MNT were expressed in an E. coli strain M15 carrying plasmid pREP4 according to the QIAGEN protocol. The cells were lysed and the MNT were purified on Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN) according to the standard procedure. The MNT were then dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 150 mM NaCl.\\n\\n\\nDetermination of mean hydrodynamic diameter of MNT\\n\\nParticle sizes of DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF (66 μM) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 150 mM NaCl were measured using a ZetaPALS (Brookhaven Instruments, Holtsville NY). The instrument was validated with nano-sphere size standards (polystyrene microspheres in water, 92 ± 3.7 nm) from Duke Scientific (Palo Alto, CA). The scattered light was detected at a 90° angle. Measurements were performed in 40 μL quartz cuvettes at 25°C with count rates of about 80 kCps in ten runs of 240 seconds in duration each and analyzed by multimodal size distribution analysis.\\n\\n\\nDetermination of MNT size in supported lipid bilayers\\n\\nA Digital Instruments multimode scanning probe microscope on a Nanoscope IIIa (Veeco Instruments, Woodbury, NY) controller fitted with a J-scanner (165 μm maximum scan size) and a tapping mode liquid cell were used to image MNT molecules in the lipid bilayer in situ. A piece of mica was attached to a 1.6 cm diameter metal disk supplied by Veeco and installed in the microscope. The tapping mode liquid cell was fitted with inlet and outlet tubing to allow exchange of solutions in the cell during imaging. Samples of supported unilamellar bilayers were prepared as described earlier.16,17 Oxide-sharpened silicon nitride V-shaped cantilevers with a nominal force constant of 0.06 N/m and a tip with a 10 nm curvature radius were used and the forces were minimized during the scans. The silicon nitride cantilevers were irradiated with ultraviolet light prior to imaging to remove any adventitious organic contaminants. All measurements were performed in contact and tapping modes (cantilever drive frequencies approximately 9 kHz) at room temperature using a tip scan rate of about 2–4 Hz. All images were captured as 512 × 512 pixels and were flattened and smoothed.\\n\\nMNT (DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF) caused formation of two types of defects in previously intact parts of the bilayer, ie, fluctuating holes, partially edged with “heights” and circular structures with “ramparts” in the lipid bilayers (Figure 2B).16,17 The mean width of these circular structures and their mean diameter were measured (Figure 2B). The width was measured in the plane of the lipid bilayer. The mean width of the MNT molecule was calculated as the mean width of circular structures with correction for a widening caused by final sizes of the tips. This correction was made under the condition r1 ≥ hc/2 according to the following formula: \\nΔd=8·r1·hc-hc, where Δd, is the widening of apparent width of circular structures; r1 is the tip curvature radius; and hc is the mean height of circular structures. The height of the MNT molecule was calculated as the height above the mica surface of the molecules observed on the border of fluctuating holes. The mean length of the MNT molecule in the lipid bilayer (l) was calculated using its mean height (h), mean width (w) and volume (V = πD3/6), where D is the mean hydrodynamic diameter. The shape of the MNT molecule in lipid bilayer was approximated as an ellipsoid, where l = 6V/πhw.\\n\\n\\nLabeling MNT\\n\\nDTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH was labeled with 125I by reaction with N-succinimidyl 3-[125I]iodobenzoate18 in 50 mM borate buffer and purified on a PD10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).\\n\\n\\nPhotosensitizers\\n\\nChlorin e6 was obtained from Frontier Scientific (Logan, UT) and bacteriochlorin p was kindly provided by the Moscow State Academy of Fine Chemical Technologies.\\n\\n\\nCoupling photosensitizers to MNT\\n\\nPhotosensitizers were coupled to MNT using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Conjugates were purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex-G50 (Pharmacia, Philadelphia, PA) column in the presence of 1.5 M guanidine hydrochloride or by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN).\\n\\n\\nCell culture\\n\\nA431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells overexpressing EGFR, as well as Cloudman S91 (clone M3) and B16-F1 murine melanoma cells overexpressing αMSH receptors were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/mL gentamicin. All cell lines were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. A431 and B16-F1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and passed in the laboratory through less than 30 passages.\\n\\n\\nMice\\n\\nAll animal procedures were conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the Dierexperimentencommissie Faculteit Farmacie/Scheikunde/Biologie, the Gemeenschappelijk Dieren Laboratorium, and the Institute of Gene Biology.\\n\\n\\nDelayed-type hypersensitivity reaction\\n\\nSubcutaneous injection of MNT was performed to evaluate delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (see Supplementary data, Materials and methods section).\\n\\n\\nMNT tissue distribution\\n\\nFemale C57 black/6J mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 × 106 B16-F1 murine melanoma cells, and 7–13 days later 125I-labeled DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH ([125I]iodoMNT) was injected intravenously in 500 μL of saline with gentamicin 50 μg/mL as follows: 850 μg, specific activity 6.5 μCi/mg, three mice; 214 μg, specific activity 36 μCi/mg, three mice; and 11 μg, specific activity 224 μCi/mg, nine mice. Biodistribution was studied for all doses at 3 hours, and the 11 μg dose was also evaluated at 70 minutes and 15 hours. Mice were anesthetized, euthanized, and their tumors and proximal skin and muscle were removed, weighed, and counted for 125I (RiaGamma 1271). Tumor-to-normal tissue ratios were calculated by dividing the 125I counts per gram tumor by the 125I counts per gram normal tissue.\\n\\n\\nMNT subcellular localization\\n\\nFemale DBA/2 mice bearing Cloudman melanoma S91 (M3 clone, transfected stably with green fluorescent protein [GFP] via copGFP gene) or C57 black female mice bearing B16-F1 melanoma were injected intravenously three times at 30-minute intervals with 150 mg/kg DTox-HMP-NLS- αMSH in 0.87–1 mL saline (depending on animal weight) with 50 μg/mL gentamicin. Three hours after the last injection, the mice were sacrificed and perfused with phosphate-buffered saline. Tumors and surrounding normal tissues were removed, embedded in GSV 1 tissue embedding medium (Slee Medical GmbH, Mainz, Germany) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissue blocks were cut into 10 μm sections using a Leica CM1510 cryotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), fixed in acetone/methanol (2:3, v/v) mixture for 10 minutes at −20°C, air-dried, stained with primary rabbit anti-MNT antibodies (Ab), followed by staining with secondary goat antirabbit Ab conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) then with tertiary donkey antigoat Ab conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555, and also with DAPI in order to visualize cell nuclei.\\n\\nLikewise, male Balb/c ByJIco-nu/nu mice bearing A431 human epidermoid carcinoma xenografts were injected intravenously with 3 mg of chlorin e6-DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF conjugate in 750 μL of saline with 50 μg/mL gentamicin; a control group did not receive the conjugate. Three hours later, the mice in both groups were sacrificed, perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, and their tumors and surrounding normal tissues were removed. The specimens were embedded in Lowicryl K4M, sectioned at 2–3 μm using an LKB-3 microtome (LKB, Uppsala, Sweden), and stained as described above (tertiary Ab staining omitted).\\n\\nSubcellular localization was investigated using an LSM 510 META NLO multiphoton laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Mai Tai broadband mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser (Spectra Physics®) with a 63× or 40× objective lens, NA 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. Alexa Fluor 555 fluorescence was excited with a He-Ne laser (543 nm); DAPI fluorescence was two-photon excited with a Ti-sapphire laser (800 nm), and GFP fluorescence was excited with an Ar laser (458 nm). When evaluating A431 specimens, Alexa Fluor 555 fluorescence was separated from autofluorescence by analysis of fluorescence spectra within the 564–704 nm range using the microscope META system and a linear unmixing standard procedure. To calculate the percentage of fields with specific MNT signal in tumor and neighboring skin cells, nuclei and cytoplasm were defined by DAPI fluorescence and transmitted light images, respectively. At least 89 fields of approximately the same area were used for each point and the average Alexa Fluor 555 signal intensity was measured in each field. A signal was considered to be specific if it exceeded the intensity of fluorescence in 95% of the control field area (tissue sections processed in the same manner but obtained from control mice not receiving MNT).\\n\\n\\nIn vivo efficacy\\n\\n\\nB16-F1 melanoma\\n\\nA total of 5 × 105 B16-F1 melanoma cells in 10 μL Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium were inoculated subcutaneously into the depilated right hind flanks of female C57 black/6J mice. Four days later, mice were injected intravenously with either 27 μg of bacteriochlorin p coupled with 1 mg DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH in 500 μL of saline containing 50 μg/mL gentamicin (n = 5; MNT-bacteriochlorin group) or 27 μg of bacteriochlorin p in 500 μL of saline containing 50 μg/mL gentamicin (n = 5; bacteriochlorin group); nine untreated mice served as controls. After 3 hours, the tumors were illuminated with a 400 W lamp (ELT) through an interference filter (transmittance maximum at 761 nm), 380 mW/cm2 fluence rate, and 360 J/cm2 illumination dose. This injection/illumination scheme was repeated on days 6, 8, 11, and 13 after melanoma cell inoculation.\\n\\n\\nCloudman S91 melanoma\\n\\nA total of 5 × 105 Cloudman S91 (clone M3) melanoma cells in 10 μL of Hanks’ solution were inoculated subcutaneously into the depilated right hind flanks of female DBA/2 mice. Three days later, the mice were injected intravenously with either 19 μg of bacteriochlorin p coupled with 1 mg of DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH in 230 μL of saline containing 50 μg/mL gentamicin (n = 5, MNT-bacteriochlorin group) or 19 μg of bacteriochlorin p in 230 μL of saline containing 50 μg/mL gentamicin (n = 4; bacteriochlorin group); eight untreated mice served as controls. After 3 hours, tumors were illuminated with a 400 W lamp (ELT) through an interference filter (transmittance maximum at 761 nm), 38 mW/cm2 fluence rate, and 36 J/cm2 illumination dose. On days 4, 5, 6, and 7 after tumor cell inoculation, the MNT-bacteriochlorin group received 24 μg of bacteriochlorin p coupled with 1.2 mg of DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH in 280 μL of saline containing 50 μg/mL gentamicin and the bacteriochlorin group received 24 μg of bacteriochlorin p in 280 μL of saline containing 50 μg/mL gentamicin; 3 hours later, tumors were illuminated at 761 nm, 380 mW/cm2 fluence rate, and 360 J/cm2 illumination dose.\\n\\n\\nHuman A431 epidermoid carcinoma\\n\\nA total of 1 × 106 A431 cells in 10 μL of phosphate-buffered saline were inoculated subcutaneously into the right hind flanks of male Balb/c ByJIco-nu/nu mice. On days 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, and 20, mice were injected intravenously with either 44 μg chlorin e6 coupled with 3 mg DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF in 750 μL of saline containing 50 μg/mL gentamicin (n = 8; MNT-chlorin group) or 44 μg of chlorin e6 in 500 μL of saline containing 50 μg/mL gentamicin (n = 10; chlorin group); 11 untreated mice comprised the control group. After 3 hours, the tumors were illuminated with a laser beam (Biolitec AG, Jena, Germany) at 652 nm (80 mW/cm2 fluence rate and 48 J/cm2 illumination dose for the first and second treatments; 100 mW/cm2 fluence rate and 60 J/cm2 illumination dose for later treatments).\\n\\n\\nTumor response\\n\\nPercentage of tumor growth inhibition was calculated as a normalized difference between the change in control and treated tumor volumes on the last day that all animals were alive in all treatment and control groups.19 Additional details are provided in the Supplementary data.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nError bars represent the mean value ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance for tumor growth inhibition and survival studies was determined by the Mann–Whitney test; other analyses used Student’s t-test. P < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nMNT design\\n\\nSmall-sized (mean hydrodynamic diameter 10.6 ± 0.5 nm, Figure 2A) specific multifunctional MNT demonstrated excellent results in enhancement of photodynamic effects of photosensitizers on cancer cell lines in vitro, but their action on tumors was not investigated up to this time. Such an approach has advantages when precise delivery of a relatively small number of molecules per cell is sufficient for a therapeutic effect. In this sense, use of photosensitizers is a convenient way for testing the approach in vivo. MNT DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH and DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF were designed to facilitate four subcellular routing events, ie, receptor binding, endocytosis, endosomal escape, and nuclear import, by combining four functional modules from their N-terminal to C-terminal ends (Figure 1). Functionality of all these modules was checked as previously described12,16,17 and confirmed. MNT were capable of specific interaction with targeted receptors, being overexpressed on tumor cells, and subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis.12,16\\n\\nAt endosomal pH, MNT embedded into the lipid bilayer and could self-assemble into circular structures16,17 (Figure 2B). Analyzing these specific structures, we estimated the mean height, width, and length of the MNT molecule as 5.3 ± 0.4, 9.0 ± 0.9, and 12.5 ± 1.9 nm (±SEM), respectively. On the basis of these dimensions and a mean diameter of the circular structures of 43.1 ± 1.2 nm, the mean number of MNT molecules in these circular structures was calculated to be 11 ± 2. These structures formed pores,16,17 permitting escape of MNT into the hyaloplasm,12 where they can interact with importins. Finally, MNT interacted with the α/β importin heterodimer, mediating nuclear import with an affinity very close to that for the same NLS as a free oligopeptide.12,16\\n\\nMurine melanomas (Cloudman S91, clone M3, and B16-F1 cell lines) as well as human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells were chosen for treatment of experimental tumors overexpressing the αMSH receptor and EGFR, respectively. MNT and their photosensitizer conjugates retained bioactivity after storage at 4°C or even after long-term storage in freeze-dried form at room temperature (see Supplementary data, Figures S1 and S2).\\n\\n\\nMNT toxicity and immunogenicity\\n\\nC57 black/6J mice (n = 3, 4-week observation) tolerated the highest achievable intravenous dose of DTox-HMPNLS- αMSH (7.5 mg), slowly injected in 1.5 mL of saline with 50 μg/mL gentamicin; higher MNT doses could not be evaluated because of limitations in MNT solubility. C57 black/6J (n = 5, 2-week observation) and Balb/c ByJIco-nu/nu (n = 8, 4-week observation) mice also tolerated multiple intravenous injections of 4 × 2 mg DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH and 6 × 3 mg DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF, respectively, with time intervals of 2–3 days between doses. Intravenous administration of DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF to C57 black/6J at a dose of 4 mg per mouse did not lead to significant changes in behavior or macroscopic organ changes, when compared with animals injected with the same volume of saline. In the microscopic study, the only significant change relative to the control group was a 30% reduction in the number of binuclear hepatocytes, which may indicate a decrease in liver proliferative capacity (data obtained in collaboration with Zenkova et al, manuscript in preparation). These data show that MNT are not toxic to mice when administered either as a single injection at the maximum achievable dose or when administered in multiple dose regimens.\\n\\nDelayed-type hypersensitivity reactions are often used as a correlate of immune response to administered polypeptides. 20 MNT administration induced slight delayed-type hypersensitivity in C57 black/6J mice injected with DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH (5.4%), with the difference between experimental and control groups not being statistically significant. Generally, an increase over the control group of about 20% or more is considered to indicate an immunogenic response,21 suggesting a low degree of immunogenicity for this MNT.\\n\\n\\nIn vivo targeting evaluated with 125I-labeled MNT\\n\\nDTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH was labeled with 125I using the N-succinimidyl 3-[125I]iodobenzoate reagent, a method that has been shown to decrease in vivo deiodination by up to two orders of magnitude compared with conventional electrophilic methods.18 The 125I-labeled DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH was injected intravenously into C57 black/6J mice bearing mouse melanoma tumors derived from B16-F1 cells which express about 10,000 αMSH receptors per cell,22 and the biodistribution of activity in different tissues was measured (see Supplementary data, Figure S3). The ratio of 125I activity in tumor tissue relative to that in skin and muscle was chosen as a metric for evaluating in vivo targeting because these tissues are in proximity to melanoma and their collateral damage from photodynamic therapy should be avoided.\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 3, the selectivity of 125I-labeled DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH retention generally increases with time. Tumor selectivity tends to be higher with doses of MNT ≥ 200 μg, than with 11 μg. The optimal dose seen for targeting at 3 hours was 214 μg for tumor:skin (9.8 ± 1.8) and 850 μg for tumor:muscle (13.4 ± 1.7) with a slightly higher tumor:muscle ratio than tumor:skin ratio, presumably reflecting the presence of melanocytes which express αMSH receptors in normal skin.23 It is worth noting that the maximum tumor:skin ratio determined for MNT in this work is 3–8 times higher than those reported for free photosensitizers in this murine melanoma model.24–26\\n\\nBased on these data demonstrating that tumor selectivity generally increases (Figure 3) while tumor accumulation rapidly decreases with time (dropping by more than 90% from 3 to 15 hours, see Supplementary data, Figure S4), we had chosen a time interval of 3 hours as a “happy medium” of significant tumor accumulation and selectivity rates for subsequent distribution and therapeutic experiments.\\n\\n\\nIn vivo targeting evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy\\n\\nDTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH was injected intravenously into DBA/2 mice bearing Cloudman S91 melanoma, which express about 5000 αMSH receptors per cell22 and into C57 black/6J mice bearing B16-F1 mouse melanoma expressing about 10,000 αMSH receptors per cell.22 Preferential tumor accumulation of MNT was observed at 3 hours after injection, which was distinguished from surrounding nontumor tissue by GFP fluorescence of transfected Cloudman S91 melanoma cells (Figure 4A–D). Moreover, comparison of MNT to DAPI staining suggested that a considerable fraction of MNT accumulation in both B16-F1 and Cloudman S91 melanoma cells occurred in the cell nuclei (Figure 5D–I). The percentage of fields exhibiting an MNT signal in nuclei and cytoplasm of tumor and proximal skin cells was also evaluated. As shown in Figure 4E, more than 80% and nearly 100% of fields in melanoma had an MNT signal in the nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively, compared with values of <40% in skin. Because MNT internalization and transport to nuclei via cytoplasm is going on from outside continuously, we can only observe a “snapshot” of intracellular distribution of the MNT, with a significant part caught on its way (eg, in the cytoplasm) to the target compartment. Similar results were obtained after intravenous injection of DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF into Balb/c ByJIco-nu/nu mice bearing EGFR-expressing human epidermoid carcinoma A431 xenografts, ie, accumulation of MNT in tumor cells with evidence for localization within the cell nuclei (Figure 5A–C). These experiments confirm that MNT can be designed to undergo transport from the blood pool to the intended subcellular target in receptor-expressing tumor cells in vivo.\\n\\n\\nIn vivo MNT antitumor efficacy\\n\\nIn order to evaluate the potential utility of MNT for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of a drug that requires localization within the cell nucleus to be effective, photodynamic therapy studies were performed in three different subcutaneous murine tumor models, with therapy initiated 3 hours after injection of the photosensitizer. The first experiment was performed in C57 black/6J mice with B16-F1 melanoma. An 89% inhibition of tumor growth was observed with the bacteriochlorin p-DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH conjugate, while no significant effect was seen with free bacteriochlorin p (Figure 6A). Median survival for mice receiving the photosensitizer-MNT conjugate was 32.0 ± 1.3 days, compared with 17.0 ± 1.5 days for the control group and 20.0 ± 5.5 days for the bacteriochlorin p group (Figure 6B). The difference in survival between photosensitizer-MNT and each of two control groups was significant (P < 0.01). The second experiment utilized DBA/2 mice with Cloudman S91 melanoma, and a 98% inhibition in tumor growth was observed with the bacteriochlorin p-DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH conjugate relative to controls (93% relative to free photosensitizers, Figure 6C). Median survival for mice receiving the photosensitizer-MNT conjugate was 56.0 ± 18.6 days compared with 21.0 ± 0.7 days for the control group and 31.0 ± 1.3 days for the bacteriochlorin p group (Figure 6D). The third experiment was performed with chlorin e6-DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF in Balb/c ByJIco-nu/nu mice with A431 human epidermoid carcinoma xenografts. A 98% inhibition in tumor growth was observed with the chlorin e6-DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF conjugate relative to controls (94% relative to free photosensitizers, Figure 7A). Median survival for mice in the control group was 20.0 ± 0.4 days, with all animals succumbing by 24 days (Figure 7B). In contrast, 75% of animals remained alive at the end of the 92-day observation period in the chlorin e6-DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF group compared with 20% in the chlorin e6 group.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nMulticomponent systems consisting of modified biological molecules or their parts,27 biological particles or their parts,28 and even subcellular structures29 are often used as delivery systems. In this study, we describe the in vivo working polypeptide-based, multifunctional platform for targeted delivery of short-range highly cytotoxic therapeutics to the most vulnerable compartment of the tumor cell. We demonstrate that selective accumulation in tumors, with preferential accumulation in cancer cell nuclei but not in adjacent normal tissue, enhances the therapeutic efficacy of photosensitizers, a type of drug that requires localization within the cell nucleus to be effective. In designing a nanosized multifunctional vehicle for achieving efficient delivery to cell nuclei in cancer cells, the first objective was to optimize delivery to the tumor and the second was to facilitate intracellular transport to the nucleus. With regard to the former, the tumor uptake of, eg, nanoparticles, exploits the presence of 200–1200 nm pores present in tumor vascular endothelium30 via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, this generally occurs at the expense of being able to improve specificity through the addition of a receptor-addressable targeting element.31–34 Instead, given that tumor permeability and extravasation increases with decreasing molecular size, we decided to assemble an artificial multifunctional device genetically with a controllable molecular weight rather than utilize a particle scaffold with multiple functional elements decorating its surface. One cannot exclude the possibility that the enhanced permeability and retention effect can play a role when MNT-photosensitizer conjugates are administered intravenously. However, it should be noted that the enhanced permeability and retention effect can also be observed with free photosensitizers; more than 90% of them are immediately taken up by different blood proteins and lipoproteins, mainly by low-density lipoproteins, highdensity lipoproteins, and albumin.35 In tumor tissue, where extracellular pH is lower than that of normal tissue, chlorin e6 binds to low-density lipoproteins which are considered to be effective photosensitizer delivery vehicles,36 and significantly better than at neutral pH.37,38 Thus, the injected photosensitizers exist in blood mainly in a protein-bound state and their behavior is governed37 by the macromolecules and macromolecular complexes which bind them. It has been shown that the enhanced permeability and retention effect can be observed with macromolecules having an apparent molecular size larger than 40–800 kDa.39 In comparison, the molecular weight of our MNT is approximately 70 kDa, and that of low-density lipoprotein is about 3000 kDa.40 Leunig et al,41 who investigated tumor accumulation of different porphyrin-like photosensitizers, showed that the enhanced permeability and retention effect appears to be the most probable reason for the tumor selectivity of this type of photosensitizer. Therefore, qualitatively, free photosensitizer in tumor vessels and photosensitizer transported by MNT may be considered as similar in terms of enhanced permeability and retention effect, and perhaps even more favorable for the free photosensitizer.\\n\\nSelective delivery of a drug to the cell nucleus is dependent on at least three design elements, ie, a NLS, a size compatible with passage through pores in the nuclear membrane, and a means of achieving specific binding to the targeted cell population. A variety of NLS, including the one used in this study, have been shown to deliver drugs efficiently to the cell nucleus via binding to importins present in the cytoplasm.42 However, even after binding of a molecule to NLS, the size of the openings in the nuclear pore complex only increases from 8–10 nm to about 40 nm,43,44 restricting nuclear entry to larger carrier systems. Another limitation of NLS-mediated delivery is that it lacks tumor specificity. One approach that has been investigated to circumvent this problem is to couple multiple NLS to internalizing antibodies. 45,46 Although NLS conjugation was shown to enhance nuclear localization, the majority of the activity was found in other cellular compartments. A possible contributing factor to these observations is sequestration of the NLS-modified antibody in endosomes after receptor-mediated endocytosis, which could lead to proteolytic degradation of the conjugate and/or prevent significant interaction with nuclear transport receptors present in the cytoplasm.\\n\\nFor this reason, we believe that an important design element of these MNT is the provision of an endosome escape pathway, thereby increasing the probability of NLS contact with cytoplasmic importins and facilitating nuclear translocation. The translocation domain of DTox was selected for this purpose and previous studies have shown that MNT containing the DTox sequence resulted in the creation of pores in lipid bilayers at endosomal/lysosomal pH.16,17\\n\\nIn vitro, it is possible to separate the two processes involved,16 ie, MNT penetration into the cell cytoplasm and subsequent MNT nuclear accumulation in the nuclei. The cells can be additionally incubated without MNT after incubation with MNT, thus permitting cytoplasmic MNT to enter into the nuclei. However, such a method cannot be used in vivo. One needs to make frozen sections in the situation where the MNT has gone from the blood pool and intercellular space to the target cells, where the MNT is presumed to pass from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm, and finally undergo translocation to the cell nuclei. Moreover, one must utilize a method with sufficient sensitivity to detect diminishing quantities of the MNT. Fortunately, such a favorable concurrence of circumstances can be seen in Figure 5A–C, which depicts predominantly nuclear MNT accumulation. In other cases (Figure 5D–F, Figure 5G–I), we obtained images showing that MNT is in the nuclei and also in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, all the images are consistent with nuclear targeting of MNT.\\n\\nPerhaps the most relevant metric for evaluating the potential utility of MNT for transport of a drug from the blood pool to the nuclei of target cell populations is to determine the effect of MNT conjugation on the therapeutic efficacy of a drug that is cytotoxic only when localized in the cell nucleus. Although Auger electron emitting radionuclides ultimately might be the best method for eventual clinical application of MNT, they also emit other radiation with multicellular ranges. Instead, we evaluated MNT in the context of photodynamic therapy because the cytotoxic reactive oxygen species generated upon photoactivation have a radius of action of less than 0.02 μm and their effects in tumor tissue can be switched on and off nearly instantaneously with light of an appropriate wavelength.47 A time interval of 3 hours between photosensitizer-MNT or photosensitizer administration and tumor illumination was selected on the basis of previous studies using chlorin e6 and its derivatives for photodynamic therapy48 and our data on tumor-specific accumulation kinetics of MNT. In the three in vivo efficacy experiments, the nature of the tumor, receptor target, photosensitizer and MNT varied, and differences in therapeutic effectiveness of the photosensitizer-MNT (and also the free photosensitizer) were observed.\\n\\nTreatment of melanoma by photodynamic therapy is hindered substantially by almost complete absorption of light by melanin.49 For this reason, the therapeutic efficacy of DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH in the two murine melanoma models in tandem with bacteriochlorin p, a photosensitizer with an absorption peak at a wavelength (761 nm) where light penetration is better, was estimated. Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that coupling this MNT to bacteriochlorin p resulted in a more than 200-fold enhancement in cytotoxicity compared with free photosensitizer.12 Particularly given the diff iculties inherent in photodynamic therapy for melanoma, the two-fold increase in median survival and significant inhibition in tumor growth obtained with the bacteriochlorin p-DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH conjugate in both the B16-F1 and Cloudman S91 models is very encouraging. Consistent with its less pigmented nature, offering the possibility of higher light penetration, longer median survivals for photosensitizer-MNT (and free photosensitizer) were seen in animals with Cloudman S91 melanoma. However, it should be noted that the average number of αMSH receptors on B16-F1 cells in vitro is about twice that reported for Cloudman S91 cells.22\\n\\nPhotodynamic therapy was also performed with chlorin e6-DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF in athymic mice with A431 human epidermoid carcinoma xenografts in order to evaluate the therapeutic response obtainable with an MNT containing a different ligand module and in a setting less compromised by light absorption. The A431 xenograft is not pigmented and this property permits usage of photosensitizers absorbing light at a shorter wavelength (664 nm for chlorin e6 in phosphate-buffered saline) than bacteriochlorin p. Moreover, the average number of EGFR on the A431 cell line (about 106) is at least 100 times higher than the number of αMSH receptors on either the B16-F1 or Cloudman S91 melanoma cell lines, which could facilitate selective MNT binding to tumor. Finally, in vitro studies have shown that chlorin e6-DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF had a 3000 times higher efficacy compared with free photosensitizer;16 likewise, DTox-HMP-NLS- EGF labeled with the α-particle emitter 211At was significantly more cytotoxic than free 211At.50 Consistent with being the most favorable setting studied for receptor-targeted photodynamic therapy, the results obtained in terms of tumor growth delay and survival prolongation were the most striking, with 75% of animals receiving chlorin e6-DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF remaining without growing tumor at the end of the 3-month observation period.\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn summary, this study provides the first in vivo evidence that MNT can selectively deliver drugs to the nuclei of tumor cells expressing a targeted receptor. MNT can improve specificity of drugs that ultimately can result in decreased side effects for patients, which is the main advantage and goal of nanomedicine.51 Moreover, delivery of drugs requiring nuclear transport to have a meaningful cytotoxic effect can be enhanced significantly through MNT-mediated delivery in vivo. In addition, preliminary studies suggest that MNT possess low toxicity and immunogenicity, as well as the practical advantages of being a nanoscale delivery system, including ease of production, long-term stability, and uniformity of physiochemical properties. Most of the “… desired characteristics for a nanoparticle drug delivery platform …”52 can be ascribed to MNT, ie, small size, stability under physiological conditions, inherently nontoxic materials and degradation products, moderate lifetime in the circulatory system (half-life about 45 minutes in mice for MNT similar to those described here; our unpublished data), a trigger mechanism for release into the hyaloplasm from acidifying endosomes, and specific cellular and subcellular targeting. Further, compared with most nanoscale delivery systems, MNT possess the essential combination of three functional modules, designed to provide step-by-step specific delivery from the surface of the target cell to its nucleus. As already mentioned, NLS, which is necessary to achieve entry of a particle/macromolecule into the interphase nucleus, can increase the size of the opening in the nuclear pore complex from only 8–10 nm to about 40 nm, which restricts nuclear entry of larger carrier systems, including most liposomes and nanoparticles. This is one of the reasons for using MNT to achieve intranuclear delivery of drugs. Also, among the other potential advantages of MNT, one can mention their uniformity in size and composition. Finally, MNT offer the possibility of long-term storage, favorably distinguishing MNT from those nanoparticle systems that require preparation a relatively short time prior to use.53,54 Finally, because of the modular nature of MNT design, one could envisage utilizing this platform to generate personalized therapeutics by tailoring the ligand and drug profiles to the characteristics of individual patients.\\n\\nSupplementary data are available, including evaluation of MNT functionality after freeze drying, MNT toxicity results, in vivo 125I-labeled MNT tissue distribution and tumor uptake kinetics, and an additional Materials and Methods section for delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and tumor response calculations.\\n\\n\\nSupplementary data\\n\\n\\nEvaluation of MNT functionality after freeze-drying\\n\\nStability and convenience are important factors in evaluating the potential utility of a nanosystem as a platform for the development of therapeutics. To address this issue, the functional properties of the modular nanotransporter (MNT) and the MNT-photosensitizer conjugates described in this study have been investigated after being subjected to freeze-drying. The MNT, comprising epidermal growth factor (EGF) for targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is overexpressed on several cancers, including head and neck, breast carcinoma, and glioblastoma, the optimized nuclear localization sequence from SV40 large tumor antigen (NLS), the Escherichia coli hemoglobin-like protein (HMP) as a carrier module, and a translocation domain of diphtheria toxin as the endosomolytic amphipathic module (DTox) (DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF) samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8) and freeze-dried. There-after, the preparations were reconstituted by the addition of deionized water. This procedure did not affect the solubility of the MNT and its affinity for EGF receptors on A431 cells (Figure S1A). Sixteen months of storage of freeze-dried DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF under different conditions did not significantly change its binding affinity for the EGF receptor on A431 cells (Figure S1B).\\n\\n\\nIn vivo 125I-labeled MNT tissue distribution\\n\\nAs an initial investigation of the feasibility of utilizing MNT for targeted delivery of drugs such as photosensitizers or radionuclides emitting short range radiation to tumors in vivo, the whole body distribution of 125I-labeled MNT was determined in mice bearing subcutaneous B16-F1 melanoma tumors (Figure S3). However, our primary focus was on measuring tumor/skin and tumor/muscle ratios because of the potential utility of this α-MSH receptor-targeted MNT for treatment of melanoma by photodynamic therapy.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that even though the level of α-MSH receptors expressed on B16-F1 cells (about 10,000 receptors per cell4) is relatively low compared, for example, with the 340,000 sites/per cell reported for high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen5 (HMW-MAA), the tumor-targeting properties of MNT were comparable with those for anti-HMW-MAA monoclonal antibody-based constructs.5,6 Moreover, due to the modular structure of MNT, which enables easy tailoring, it could be possible, for example, to reduce liver uptake by substituting the current (His)6-tag with an HEHEHE tag, which has recently been demonstrated to result in up to 19-fold lower liver accumulation.7\\n\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n\\n\\nDelayed type hypersensitivity reaction\\n\\nFemale C57 black/6J mice (n = 11, 20–25 g) were injected subcutaneously with DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH (60 μL, 2 mg/mL Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) mixed with Freund’s complete adjuvant (1:1, v/v, Sigma). After 5 days, one hind foot pad of each mouse was injected with DTox-HMP-NLS-αMSH (40 μL, 2 mg/mL); the collateral foot was injected with only Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (experimental group). A control group of mice (n = 8) were not injected with MNT/Freund’s adjuvant. Edema was measured 24 hours later in foot pads of the experimental (mMNT,exp, and collateral, mDMEM,exp) and control (mDMEM,contr) groups8 and expressed as:Δ\\n\\nD\\n\\nT\\n\\nH\\n\\n%\\n\\n=\\n\\n(m\\n\\nM\\n\\nN\\n\\nT\\n\\n,\\n\\nexp\\n\\n-m\\n\\nD\\n\\nM\\n\\nE\\n\\nM\\n\\n,\\n\\nexp\\n\\nm\\n\\nD\\n\\nM\\n\\nE\\n\\nM\\n\\n,\\n\\nexp\\n\\n-m\\n\\nM\\n\\nN\\n\\nT\\n\\n,\\n\\nexp\\n\\n-m\\n\\nD\\n\\nM\\n\\nE\\n\\nM\\n\\n,\\n\\nc\\n\\no\\n\\nn\\n\\nt\\n\\nr\\n\\nm\\n\\nD\\n\\nM\\n\\nE\\n\\nM\\n\\n,\\n\\nc\\n\\no\\n\\nn\\n\\nt\\n\\nr)\\n\\n×\\n\\n100\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\nPreparation of primary rabbit anti-MNT antibodies\\n\\nThe antibodies against MNT were raised in rabbits, according to the method described by Burns.9 Briefly, 1-year old female rabbits (weight approximately 3.5 kg) were firstly immunized subcutaneously with 0.7 mL at each site using a HMP-NLS-αMSH and complete Freund’s adjuvant mixture (1:1, final concentration of HMP-NLS-αMSH 0.35 mg/mL). The injections were performed into two rows of four sites equidistantly spaced along the rabbit’s back and into both knee joint capsules. Rabbits were reimmunized three more times by subcutaneous injections of 0.5 mL each into four sites on the back at 7, 37, and 44 days. Donor bleeds were taken from an ear artery after the second and third immunizations. The antiserum was separated from the clotted blood by centrifugation and stored at −20°C.\\n\\nThe immunoglobulin fraction was obtained by ammonium persulfate precipitation. Briefly, cooled to 4°C, ammonium persulfate solution (800 g/L) was added to antiserum at a final concentration of 28%. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 4°C at 20,000 g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was then precipitated again by ammonium persulfate (up to 50%) and centrifuged as described above. The pellet was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. This procedure was repeated twice. The purified immunoglobulin fraction was then finally purified by affinity chromatography using the immobilized antigen on CNBr Sepharose. The affinity of the purified antibodies to the antigen was assayed by plate-trapped double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.10\\n\\n\\nTumor response\\n\\nTumor growth was measured at regular intervals with micro-calipers in two orthogonal dimensions; tumor volume was calculated according to formula V = 0.5 × length × width. Animals were euthanized when the tumor volume exceeded 1200 mm3, in the case of tumor ulceration, or other signs of animal distress. Survival was recorded as the percentage of animals surviving on a given day.Figure S1\\n\\nCompetition for binding to A431 cells with [125I]iodoEGF for DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF.

Competition experiments were carried out in 48-well plates with 2 nM of [125I]iodoEGF and incremental concentrations of MNT in 200 μL of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 20 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3. The plates were incubated at 4°C for 20 hours, washed three times with Hanks’ solution containing bovine serum albumin, then cells were lysed with 0.5 M NaOH, and the radioactivity in the cell lysates was measured with a gamma counter. The affinity constant of [125I]iodoEGF to EGF receptors ((0.149 ± 0.015) × 109 L/mol) was assessed after experiments with binding of incrementing concentrations of the labeled EGF using SigmaPlot 10 software. Nonspecific binding, measured by coincubation with 1 μM non-labeled EGF, did not exceed 5% of total binding. The association constants for ligand binding were calculated by nonlinear regression of binding data1 with a one-site binding model. All experiments were carried out in triplicate, and error bars represent the SEM. The phototoxicity of DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF-bacteriochlorin p for A431 cells was not affected by freeze-drying/reconstitution (Figure S2). The EC50 determined for the MNT-photosensitizer conjugate before and after freeze drying/reconstitution were 3.4 ± 0.5 nM and 4.2 ± 1.6 nM, respectively (P > 0.7). Incubation of A431 cells with MNT DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF without subsequent irradiation did not affect cell growth up to MNT concentrations sufficient for complete photodynamic mediated cell death. Free photosensitizer (chlorin e6) did not affect cell viability at the irradiation doses used for this particular experiment (270 kJ/cm2), as well as up to more than 500 kJ/cm2.3\\n\\n\\nAbbreviations: MNT, modular nanotransporter; DTox, translocation domain of diphtheria toxin; HMP, Escherichia coli hemoglobin-like protein; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SEM, standard error of the mean.Figure S2\\n\\nPhotocytotoxicity of DTox-HMP-NLS-EGF-bacteriochlorin p before (squares) and after (triangles) freeze-drying and reconstitution.

Like most CNS neurons, RGCs are considered incapable of mounting long distance axon regeneration. Using immunolabeling-enabled 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO) in transgenic mice, we tracked the entire paths of individual RGC axons and show that adult RGCs are highly capable of spontaneous long-distance regeneration, even without any treatment. Our results show that the Thy1-H-YFP mouse sparsely labels RGCs, consisting predominantly of regeneration-competent &#x003b1;-type RGCs (&#x003b1;RGCs). Following optic nerve crush, many of the YFP-labeled RGC axons extend considerable distances proximal to the injury site with only a few penetrating through the lesion. This tortuous axon growth proximal to the lesion site is even more striking with intravitreal ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) treatment. We further demonstrate that despite traveling more than 5 mm (i.e., a distance equal to the length of mouse optic nerve), many of these circuitous axons are confined to the injury area and fail to reach the brain. Our results re-evaluate the view that RGCs are naturally incapable of re-extending long axons, and shift the focus from promoting axon elongation, to understanding factors that prevent direct growth of axons through the lesion and the injured nerve.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>clearing</kwd><kwd>CNS</kwd><kwd>iDISCO</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>RGC</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type=\"funder-id\">http://doi.org/10.13039/100000053</named-content>\\nHHS | NIH | National Eye Institute (NEI)</funding-source><award-id>1R01EY022961</award-id><award-id>1R21EY026668</award-id><award-id>1U01EY027257</award-id><award-id>1F30EY025527</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>E.

Using whole tissue immunolabeling, we establish a technique to visualize and trace the entire paths of small populations of genetically labeled RGC axons as they regenerate. Following optic nerve injury, few axons grow beyond the lesion, but we find these axons branch and form loops proximal to the lesion. A regeneration inducing treatment further exacerbates branching and tortuous growth, while only modestly increasing the number of RGC axons that successfully grow beyond the lesion. Our study demonstrates extensive and circuitous RGC axon elongation both in pre- and post-lesion regions, highlighting the need to better understand the factors that inhibit direct axon growth in the optic nerve.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"intro\" id=\"s2\"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lack of axon regeneration is a major obstacle preventing functional recovery after axon injury. Like other neurons in the CNS, it is thought that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) have a limited ability to regenerate spontaneously. Nonetheless, growth factors or modification of genes promote RGC axonal regeneration, to some extent. For example, supplying RGCs with cytokines, or genetic modification of <italic>Pten</italic>, <italic>Pcaf</italic>, <italic>Stat3</italic>, <italic>Socs3</italic>, <italic>c-Myc</italic>, <italic>dcxl</italic>, or <italic>Klf4</italic> allows some RGC axons to regenerate with few axons reaching the brain targets (<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Moore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid=\"B25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Puttagunta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Belin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Nawabi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Leibinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Mehta et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Multiple reports have demonstrated that some regenerating RGC axons travel circuitously within the optic nerve after intraorbital crush injury (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Luo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Pernet et al., 2013</xref>). However, these studies have used anterograde tracers that label all RGC axons, making it difficult to identify individual fibers and visualize how axons of different RGC types behave as they regenerate. Here we sought to combine sparse neuronal labeling with the immunolabeling-enabled 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO) technique (<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Renier et al., 2016</xref>) and trace the entire path of individual axons as they regenerate.</p><p>RGCs are a heterogeneous population of neurons. They are divided into several subclasses based on their morphologic, physiologic, and molecular properties. Previous studies have shown that different RGC types differ in their ability to regenerate axons. For instance, studies in cats have shown that &#x003b1;RGCs regenerate axons better than other RGC types (<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Watanabe and Fukuda, 2002</xref>). Similarly, in mice it was demonstrated that &#x003b1;RGCs have greater propensity to regenerate axons after crush injury (<xref rid=\"B6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Duan et al., 2015</xref>). RGCs in the Thy1-H-YFP mouse line have a &#x0201c;Golgi-like&#x0201d; labeling, allowing for the characterization of their dendrites and axons. Importantly, this line labels few RGCs, most of which are immune-positive for SMI-32, a marker of &#x003b1;RGCs (<xref rid=\"B9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Feng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Coombs et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we first validate that the Thy1-H-YFP mouse sparsely labels &#x003b1;RGCs. We used a combination of confocal imaging and iDISCO to analyze the dendrites and axons of the labeled neurons. We find that, after optic nerve crush, (1) &#x003b1;RGC dendrites decrease in complexity, and the dendritic arbors are even less complex in animals treated with an axon growth promoting-stimulator (i.e., CNTF); (2) innately, axons remodel and regrow extensively proximal to the crush site; and (3) following CNTF, axon elongation is extremely circuitous, and these axons never reach the brain, despite growing distances that would allow them to reach the brain, had they grown straight. Overall, our results show that RGCs can re-extend axons very well, even in the absence of a growth stimulator, but their inability to traverse the lesion area along with meandering axon growth limit &#x0201c;meaningful&#x0201d; regeneration, dramatically reducing the number of RGCs successfully regenerating axons into the brain. Our results shift the focus from promoting axon elongation, to understanding factors that prevent direct growth of CNS axons through the injured nerve.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\" id=\"s3\"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Miami.

For retinal whole mount staining, the retina was carefully dissected out of the globe and derestricting cuts were placed in each quadrant. Tissue was washed with PBS and blocked in 5% normal donkey serum (Sigma D9663) in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST).

RGCs were defined by: soma location in the ganglion cell layer or inner nuclear layer (displaced RGC), and the presence of an axon. To determine the subtype of YFP<sup>+</sup> RGCs, every YFP<sup>+</sup> RGC in a retina was assessed for immunoreactivity with a RGC subtype marker: OSPN, Opn4, or CART (see Results for <italic>n</italic> number of retinas assessed for each marker). Survival of YFP<sup>+</sup> RGCs was determined as the number of YFP<sup>+</sup> RGCs remaining or the percentage of YFP<sup>+</sup> RGCs remaining compared to the uninjured contralateral retina. To analyze RGC dendrites, high-magnification z-stack images were taken of individual RGCs from the retinal nerve fiber layer to the inner nuclear layer. Images were tiled and reconstructed if a RGC&#x02019;s dendrites extended out of field. Dendrites were traced using ImageJ/FIJI and the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin (<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Longair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Linear Sholl analysis was completed using the Sholl analysis plugin for ImageJ/FIJI (<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>). Sholl analysis data were analyzed as the average number of intersections observed in radii bins of 30 &#x000b5;m.

To determine how an individual axon regenerates, we traced entire axons of some RGCs (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic>,<italic>C</italic></xref>). Additionally, to visualize all RGC axons, CTB conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 was injected 1 h after crush to label axons anterogradely. Even at this early stage (i.e., 3dpc; <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 4), some axons regrew within a small area near the cut end. However, there were no axons beyond the lesion site.

All YFP<sup>+</sup> axons are clearly disconnected, and no CTB labeled axons are found far distal to the lesion site (i.e., 1 mm distal to lesion site), strongly indicating that the injury is complete and no axons are spared from axotomy. These results show that some YFP<sup>+</sup> axons begin growing soon after injury (3dpc). Notably, this initial growth appears independent to the presence of CNTF.</p><p>Second, we observed the growth pattern of YFP<sup>+</sup> axons at an intermediate time point. At 3wpc, YFP<sup>+</sup> axons in AAV-CNTF-treated animals (CNTF + 3wpc, <italic>n</italic> = 4 animals) regrew within regions proximal to the lesion site, forming complex branched and looped structures.

We observed that axon branching occurs frequently following crush. Approximately half of the axons have 1 or more branches (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>, 6wpc). AAV-CNTF significantly increased the number of axons with branches (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and the number of branches per axon (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic>, 6w</xref>pc vs CNTF + 6wpc). Next, we sought to characterize for each axon (1) total axon length, (2) how far centrally an axon reached (maximum distance achieved from the optic disk), and (3) how much aberrant growth occurred (aberrant growth = axon total length &#x02013; maximum distance achieved; <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">Fig. 6<italic>C&#x02013;E</italic></xref>). Given that the proximal edge of the crush site is &#x0223c;1 mm from the optic disk, we see that most axons in the injury control animals remain within or near the lesion site (i.e., within 0.8&#x02013;1.2 mm from the optic disk). Surprisingly, even in the absence of growth promoting factors many of these axons grew (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5\">Figs. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref><italic>C</italic>\\n). This growth was mostly within the region proximal to the crush. Some axons grew between 1 and 2 mm in length. This growth consists of branches and loops, growth that does not extend the axon distally along the optic nerve (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5\">Figs. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref><italic>E</italic>). Together, these results show that YFP<sup>+</sup> RGCs are innately capable of regrowing long axons; however, these axons are unable to successfully traverse the lesion.</p><p>Consistent with the regeneration promoting effects of CNTF, axons grew significantly longer than controls (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Like the injured control animals, many axons failed to grow through the lesion site, and most regrowth was aberrant (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">Fig. 6<italic>E</italic></xref>). In CNTF animals, the axon length measurement shows that despite growing &#x0003e;4&#x02013;5 mm, some axons are restricted to the lesion area. Independent of treatment, the maximum distance along the optic nerve most growing axons achieve is associated with the lesion site, around 1000 &#x000b5;m from the optic disk (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>, distance of lesion site from optic disk indicated as horizontal reference line at 1000 &#x000b5;m). In fact, the median maximum distance achieved by axons in CNTF animals was only 25% longer than that of the control injured animals despite the fact that the CNTF axons grew 3- to 4-fold longer in total length (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">Fig. 6<italic>C&#x02013;E</italic></xref>). <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F7\">Figure 7<italic>A</italic></xref> shows reconstructed axons of the CNTF + 6wpc 3 optic nerve from different viewing angles. This pattern of regrowth was also evident in the fourth animal (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F7\">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic>, CN</xref>TF + 6wpc 4). While we were unable to trace each axon from the optic nerve head to termination, we determined that no more than three axons grew beyond the lesion site (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F7\">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>, arrowheads). As shown in the cross view of the optic nerve (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F7\">Fig. 7</xref>, images in the right panels), some axons wrap around the nerve several rounds, further illustrating the extensiveness of tortuous growth.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=\"discussion\" id=\"s5\"><title>Discussion</title><p>RGCs of different subtypes are connected to distinct presynaptic partners and exhibit an array of responses to visual stimuli. RGCs of different subtypes also project their axons to different brain targets and contribute to image-forming functions as well as non-imaging forming functions (<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Sanes and Masland, 2015</xref>) Anatomically, how do the dendrites and axons of specific RGC types respond to axotomy, as well as after treatments with factors that stimulate axon growth? In the retina, several studies have characterized RGC type-specific changes in dendrite morphology after traumatic axotomy or in glaucoma models. As such, changes in dendrites after insult have been described to some extent. However, the abilities of specific RGC types to regenerate axons and correctly find their targets in adult mammals are just beginning to be determined. Since some studies have shown that many regenerating RGC axons grow circuitously near the lesion and fail to regenerate far, we sought to combine sparse neuronal labeling with iDISCO and follow individual axons derived primarily from one RGC type; &#x003b1;RGC. The major observations in this study are (1) &#x003b1;RGC dendrites decrease their complexity following axotomy, and this response to axotomy is exacerbated by CNTF treatment; (2) YPF<sup>+</sup> RGC axons grow over unexpectedly long distances before the lesion site with only a few axons being able to successfully traverse the lesion; and (3) YFP<sup>+</sup> axons that do regenerate beyond the lesion site elongate aberrantly, form many collateral axons in the optic nerve and fail to reach the brain.</p><sec id=\"s5A\"><title>Considerations for cell types of origin of the YFP<sup>+</sup> processes</title><p>Our results show that the majority of surviving YFP<sup>+</sup> RGCs after injury are immunoreactive for OSPN, indicating that most of these YFP<sup>+</sup> RGCs belong to &#x003b1;RGCs (<xref rid=\"B6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Duan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Sanes and Masland, 2015</xref>).

However, because 24% of surviving RGCs are OSPN-negative (i.e., of the 13 surviving YFP<sup>+</sup> RGCs per retina, 10 are YFP<sup>+</sup>/OSPN<sup>+</sup> and 3 are YFP<sup>+</sup>/OSPN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), we are unable to conclusively determine if the axons that grew beyond the lesion site are of &#x003b1;RGC origin.</p></sec><sec id=\"s5B\"><title>Changes in &#x003b1;RGC dendrites in responses to axotomy and CNTF</title><p>Using transgenic mice that label defined RGC types, previous studies have examined the morphologic changes that occur in RGC dendrites. In a mouse glaucoma model, OFF transient RGCs showed decreased dendritic arborization (<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Della Santina et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the dendritic complexity of transient OFF &#x003b1;RGCs from glaucomatous mouse eyes is reduced (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">El-Danaf and Huberman, 2015</xref>). Thus, the results in our study showing loss of dendritic complexity in &#x003b1;RGCs are in line with these previous reports. In contrast, in adult rats, peripheral nerve graft and AAV-CNTF cause an increase in soma size of RGCs without affecting the dendritic complexity or field size (<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Rodger et al., 2012</xref>). However, when examined specifically in the RGC 1 subtype (i.e., RGCs with a large soma), AAV-CNTF caused a significant reduction in the complexity of the dendritic arbors, again without reducing the field size (<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Rodger et al., 2012</xref>). In line with the previous study, our results show that AAV-CNTF leads to a significant decrease in arbor complexity without altering the dendritic field size in most cells. Thus, our results suggest that while &#x003b1;RGC axons are highly regenerative and quite likely generate complex arbors (i.e., in response to CNTF), their dendrites become less complex. In this regard, one could ask why and how does CNTF cause even greater reduction in dendrite complexity in these RGCs? The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying such different behaviors by the axons and dendrites are unknown. It is also unclear whether the reduction in dendrite arbor complexity will be potentially disruptive for the function of these RGCs (i.e., receive less input from their presynaptic partners). These are interesting questions that may deserve further investigation.</p><p>We observed that the majority of YFP-labeled &#x003b1;RGCs (&#x0223c;80%) in this experimental example died at six weeks after injury. Currently, it is unclear whether these YFP<sup>+</sup> &#x003b1;RGCs die long after injury because of lack of intrinsic survival signals or because they are disconnected for a long time and lack trophic support from the target. It is also possible that they die because they remain unmyelinated (i.e., not remyelinated) for a long period time, lacking the survival signal(s) and other type(s) of support from the oligodendrocytes (or even astrocytes). The question why most RGCs die remains nebulous and justifies further investigation.</p></sec><sec id=\"s5C\"><title>Highly regenerative yet unable to go far</title><p>Several prior studies have adopted tissue clearing strategies and examined axon regeneration in unsectioned, whole CNS tissues (Ert&#x000fc;rk et al., 2011; <xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Laskowski and Bradke, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Luo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Pernet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Soderblom et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we sought to expand the 3D analysis to track single axons in given neuronal types. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report the adaptation of sparse labeling and whole tissue staining to attain the entire projection profiles of regenerating axons. Perhaps the most striking observation in our study was the extensive and circuitous regeneration of RGC axons occurring proximal to the lesion site. Axons start to penetrate through the lesion, sometime more than once, but each time they turn back toward the retina and thus they elongate within the proximal optic nerve region (i.e., near the optic nerve head). Additionally, axons that surpass the lesion continue to branch and misroute, with these events lacking an obvious spatial pattern (e.g., occurring near the lesion site). We also note that none of these axons grew past the optic chiasm. As can be seen in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">Figures 4</xref><xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5 F6\">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F7\">7</xref>, regenerating axons stop at different distances away from the chiasm. Previous studies have suggested that optic chiasm may inhibit or halt some axons to grow further (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Luo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Crair and Mason, 2016</xref>). At least for these neurons however, the reason that they fail to grow past the chiasm does not seem to be due to chiasmatic barrier as these axons terminate or turn toward the eye even before they get close to the optic chiasm.</p><p>How does an axon successfully traverse the lesion? In the CNS lesion, various growth inhibitory molecules are present. Molecular barriers within the lesion area include chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and myelin-associated inhibitors (<xref rid=\"B36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Yiu and He, 2006</xref>). Astrocytes and fibroblasts interact to establish a scar, surrounding the lesion. Therefore, to successfully traverse the lesion, a growing axon will need to modify the extracellular matrix (ECM) and overcome inhibitory/repulsive cues. Differential expression of ECM modifying enzymes and cell surface receptors may explain why some axons never cross the lesion while others do. This simple explanation is challenged by our finding that axons proximal to the lesion form extensive branches and loops and then eventually grow through the lesion (i.e., <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic>, CN</xref>TF + 6wpc 1). For this to occur, axons would need to be dynamically responsive to their environment and alter gene expression accordingly (i.e., after failing to traverse the lesion, they change expression of certain molecules to better suit the lesion environment), or crossing the lesion site is a stochastic event. Future investigation will be needed to identify if specific RGCs are can cross the lesion barrier, and what interventions can help axons through this environment.</p><p>The tracing of individual axons allowed us to measure the total length of individual axons as well as the maximum distances from the eye. Unequivocally, we find that while many axons travel long distances, their circuitous growth results in them remaining within close vicinity to the lesion site. The observation that the regenerating axons grow aberrantly within the optic nerve is mostly in agreement with previous studies (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Luo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Pernet et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, our current study provides a complete picture of individual axon trajectory, from their entry into the optic nerve to the end of their route. This is particularly the case for the portion of axons located in the proximal area to the injury site which was not possible in the previous studies that have used CTB as a tracer for all RGC axons. Overall, our results build on prior studies and further show that the growth of YFP<sup>+</sup> RGCs axons are tortuous in their paths, and that these axons are unlikely to reinnervate their brain targets after CNTF treatment.</p></sec><sec id=\"s5D\"><title>Question of treatment and cell type-specific axon behaviors</title><p>CNTF is only one of many factors that can induce axon regeneration. Do different regeneration stimulating factors cause a similar degree of aberrant growth and misrouting? Do the axons of all RGC types have similar propensity to misroute? Studies by <xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Lim et al. (2016)</xref>, and <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">de Lima et al. (2012)</xref>, showed that at least under certain conditions, some RGC axons are able to regenerate with minimal misrouting and back to their correct targets. In some instances, these RGC axons seem to travel linearly toward the brain (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). It appears that under some conditions, RGC axons may be able to navigate through the injured optic nerve. It is unknown what molecular and cellular factors minimize misrouting and produce directed growth within the optic nerve and beyond. It may be interesting to apply 3D analysis and examine the behavior of &#x003b1;RGCs and other RGC types under additional growth-promoting conditions. This could help determine if the aberrant growth seen in the present study is specific to some RGC types or to CNTF treatment per se.</p><p>It is known that certain types of neurons in different CNS regions including the supraspinal serotonergic neurons are able to spontaneously remodel and reextend axons after axotomy (<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Hawthorne et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, other neurons including the corticospinal tract axons are strongly refractory to regeneration where the cut dystrophic axons regress with virtually no signs of regrowth (<xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Thallmair et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). In the case of RGCs, we know from studies using CTB tracing that a few of these neurons can spontaneously regrow axons, at least to some short distance into the lesion. The lengthy axons seen even without CNTF in our study indicate that RGCs (and perhaps other CNS neurons) may have much higher growth capacity than generally thought. In the case of peripheral neurons, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons send collaterals and misroute following injury to the central branch (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Kerschensteiner et al., 2005</xref>). It would be interesting to determine if this aberrant growth of DRG axons is amplified following preconditioning injury, a method to promote regeneration of a DRG&#x02019;s central branch.</p><p>These findings highlight the need for prudence when evaluating a growth factor to promote axon regeneration. CNTF and other growth factors are frequently used in regeneration studies to stimulate axon growth. In our study, CNTF produced abundant axon growth, but this growth was highly aberrant. Thus, this growth factor caused &#x0201c;too much of a good thing.&#x0201d; Therefore, future treatments must be adjusted to maximize axon growth into brain targets, and minimize axon branching and tortuous growth.</p><p>Overall, our study documents the morphologic changes that occur in &#x003b1;RGCs after optic nerve injury. Tracking the entire paths of individual axons reveal that these RGCs can naturally re-extend axons extremely well, but both their inability to traverse the lesion area and their circuitous axon growth limit reconnection with the brain. Our results counter the general view that RGC axons are incapable of lengthy regeneration, and shift the focus from promoting axon elongation, to understanding factors that prevent direct growth of axons through the injured nerve.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Acknowledgments: We thank Pingping Jia at the University of Miami Viral Vector Core and Melissa Carballosa-Gautam at the Miami

This manuscript is a welcome study on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon regeneration after optic nerve crush. You put a long-known Thy1-H-YFP line to good use: RGCs, their axons, and dendrites are labeled but only in a sparse population, the majority of which are osteopontin-expressing alpha RGCs. The path of these axons is traced several weeks post crush to demonstrate that axons can regrow proximal to and beyond the crush, but not without circling and doubling back in many cases. The study demonstrates that the application of CTNF, a growth factor known to stimulate axon regrowth, made such misrouting even more severe. Dendrites in both crush situations were diminished in several parameters, even more after CTNF treatment. The data are very clearly presented, aided by tissue clearing with iDisco and by computer-assisted axon tracing.</p><p>However, we also felt that the potential of the study has not been exploited. In essence it has been shown before that axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can regenerate over long distances. Also the finding that 76% of the regenerating fibers are of the OSPN type is not surprising and does not indicate enhanced regeneration capacity given the fact that they make up 70% of the RGCs. Therefore, these aspects are not novel and do not go beyond what is already known. Having that said we think that your results do contribute to our understanding of RGC regeneration but these aspects have not been described very well. For instance, your approach could be used to analyze whether the crush lesion does spare any axons, or in other words, how uniform the crush lesion is. The Thy-1 transgenic mouse used in this study provides a valuable model to follow up on axonal behavior in a way not possible before, because individual axons can be traced over a very long distance. Therefore, we recommend that you describe the details of the lesion much better and use it to follow up on axonal behavior at different time points after lesion. It is interesting to see that the behavior of axons and dendrites differs markedly. Again, this issue has not been described very well. In fact, at first it even seems confusing why the results of Figure 2 and Figure 5 show opposite outcomes.

We accepted all criticism and have revised the manuscript accordingly. The changes we made are emphasized in red font in the manuscript and detailed point-by-point below.</p><p>Editorial Board Comments:</p><p>- Having that said we think that your results do contribute to our understanding of RGC regeneration but these aspects have not been described very well. For instance, your approach could be used to analyze whether the crush lesion does spare any axons, or in other words, how uniform the crush lesion is. The Thy-1 transgenic mouse used in this study provides a valuable model to follow up on axonal behavior in a way not possible before, because individual axons can be traced over a very long distance. Therefore, we recommend that you describe the details of the lesion much better and use it to follow up on axonal behavior at different time points after lesion. </p><p> In our revised version, we provide a more easily understood description of the lesion with a diagram in Figure 4. We also generated more animals by examining the axon behavior at 3 days and 3 weeks after crush injury, in addition to the 6 weeks post crush in the original version.</p><p>It is interesting to see that the behavior of axons and dendrites differs markedly. Again, this issue has not been described very well. In fact, at first it even seems confusing why the results of Figure 2 and Figure 5 show opposite outcomes. The manuscript would benefit from rewriting and the inclusion of clear statements at the end of paragraphs.</p><p> We added more detailed descriptions regarding the behavior of dendrites (in comparison to that of the axons) and its potential implication (text lines 200 -202 and 331-338), and provided more explicit statements at the end of each major paragraph (e.g. lines 185-187, 200-202, 214-215, and 222)</p><p> Given that the manuscript uses a novel technique to repeat some previously published studies, it would be helpful to clearly comment on where the present study confirms and where it contradicts those studies. Please pay attention to the following issues raised by the reviewers:</p><p> In this study, we reveal the precise growth pattern of individual axons proximal and distal to the lesion site. The overall conclusion is that while regenerating axons grow aberrantly within the optic nerve distal to the injury (in agreement with previous studies cited within the manuscript), there is an unexpectedly abundant and tortuous growth of regeneration axons proximal to the injury. It was not possible to observe this previously in studies that used CTB as a tracer for all RGC axons. Remarkably, animals that did not receive regenerating factors exhibit regenerative axon growth as early as 3 days, the earliest point we examined, and they do not remain static. Furthermore, axons that escape the lesion site have strikingly abnormal routing that was not as appreciated in the previous studies. We included these points in the Discussion section (lines 381-386) to emphasize the benefit of the improved technique used in this study and how it helped us expand on the previous studies.</p><p>Reviewer 1: </p><p>- The number of animals they use per experiment use to be four. I believe they should increase the &#x0201c;n&#x0201d; in order to reach conclusions. </p><p>As the reviewer has correctly pointed out, we analyzed 4-5 animals in each of the injured groups (i.e. Crush + CNTF and Crush, 6 weeks after crush injury). The two main conclusions we have reached from these animals are that; i) the RGCs in both groups re-extend damaged axons quite extensively prior to the injury site, and at the distal region to the injury site, the axons in the Crush + CNTF group travel long distances without direction, and ii) the sparse cell labeling and whole tissue immunohistochemistry/imaging methods that we have adopted in this study are a technical expansion to previous methods and permit precise phenotypic analysis of individual regenerating axons. While it could be useful to add more animals in these groups, we think that the number of animals used is sufficient for us to reach these main conclusions. We feel confident in these conclusions due to the magnitude of the effect we observed. Having said that, as suggested by Reviewer 2, we did generate more animals to examine axon behaviors at 3 weeks after injury, and at this time point, we also see very similar axon behaviors compared to the 6 weeks post injury animals, further validating the main conclusions. In the 8 animals (n=4 CNTF+3wpc, n=4 CNTF+6wpc) that we have assessed, we have consistently observed similar axon growth behaviors. We also analyzed the behavior of animals 3 days after crush showing that the growth of axons is in both control and CNTF treated is an early and intrinsic effect. We have included results from these additional animals in the revised manuscript (Figure 4). </p><p>- Drawings indicating how do they practice the crash and arrows or lines indicating where the crash was practiced would help the reader to better follow the story. </p><p>We have now added a diagram to visualize better the injury model used in this manuscript (Figure 4 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>- I am not sure why do they insist so much in the fact that the RGCs most resistant to the crash are the alphaRGCs. First, this has been already published (as themselves point out) and second, it is expectable because the majority of the RGC labeled in the transgenic mice are precisely the alphaRGCs.</p><p> As the reviewer has pointed out, previous studies have reported that alpha RGCs tend to survive and regenerate better than other RGC types after axotomy. We would like to emphasize that it was not our intension to highlight these unique properties of alpha RGCs as new findings. Rather, we sought to underscore that this Thy1 mouse line does label this RGC type (which make it possible to assess axon regeneration in few RGCs) and more importantly, establish the feasibility of examining how axons from a specific RGC type would behave after injury and CNTF. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer about this point, and accordingly we removed or toned down the statements and description that emphasizes the unique injury responses of alpha RGCs (text lines 172 and 342 in the original version).</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>There are a number of textual and other amendments to the figures that would improve the presentation: </p><p>1.Methods - indicate the post-crush survival times that were evaluated. </p><p>We indicated the post-crush survival times in the Methods and Results sections. Since we added more time points in this revision (i.e. 3 days and 3 weeks post-crush survival times), we now describe animal groups in these time points more explicitly to avoid confusion. 3 days post-crush, 3dpc; 3 weeks post-crush, 3wpc; 6 weeks post-crush, 6wpc.</p><p>2.Figures: </p><p>a.

We initially used a 2-way repeated measures ANOVA to calculate group significance across all distances. We have now included 1-way ANOVA calculations at each distance, and have included significance indicators in 2M. p-values for each comparison have been added to the statistics table. </p><p>3. We added statement to clarify the measurement methods (lines 124-125) and included more explicit description stating the differences between the &#x0201c;Crush&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;CNTF + Crush&#x0201d; (now described as &#x0201c;6wpc&#x0201d; vs &#x0201c;CNTF + 6wpc&#x0201d;) (lines 197-200).</p><p>c.

As can be seen in Figures 4-7, regenerating axons stop at different distances (e.g. ranging from approximately 0.5 to 4-5 mm) away from the chiasm. However, at least for these neurons, the reason that they fail to grow past the chiasm does not seem to be the chiasmatic barrier as the axons terminate or turn towards the eye even before they get close to the optic chiasm. In our revised version, we included a brief description about this aspect (lines 357-363 in the new version).</p><p>d.

GAP43 antibody was a gift from Dr. Dietmar Fischer. Please see figure at the end of this document. Although there seems to be some background signal using this antibody, we observed regenerating Thy1H-YFP axons 2 weeks after optic nerve crush and AAV-CNTF injection. We observed Thy1-H+ CTB+ axon segments that show distinct Gap43 immunoreactivity, arrow heads.

As the reviewer has pointed out, the majority of alphaRGCs in this experimental example died at 6 weeks after injury. Currently, it is unclear whether these RGCs die because of lack of intrinsic survival signals or due to the fact that they are disconnected long term and lack trophic support from the target. It is also possible that they die because they remain unmyelinated (i.e. not remyelinated) for a long period time, lacking the survival signal(s) and other type(s) of support from the oligodendrocytes or even astrocytes). The question why most RGCs die remains nebulous and justifies further investigation. We have included these ideas in the discussion.

Using whole tissue immunolabeling, we establish a technique to visualize and trace the entire paths of small populations of genetically labeled RGC axons as they regenerate. Following optic nerve injury, few axons grow beyond the lesion, but we find these axons branch and form loops proximal to the lesion. A regeneration inducing treatment further exacerbates branching and tortuous growth, while only modestly increasing the number of RGC axons that successfully grow beyond the lesion. Our study demonstrates extensive and circuitous RGC axon elongation both in pre- and post-lesion regions, highlighting the need to better understand the factors that inhibit direct axon growth in the optic nerve.\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nLack of axon regeneration is a major obstacle preventing functional recovery after axon injury. Like other neurons in the CNS, it is thought that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) have a limited ability to regenerate spontaneously. Nonetheless, growth factors or modification of genes promote RGC axonal regeneration, to some extent. For example, supplying RGCs with cytokines, or genetic modification of Pten, Pcaf, Stat3, Socs3, c-Myc, dcxl, or Klf4 allows some RGC axons to regenerate with few axons reaching the brain targets (Park et al., 2008; Moore et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009; Puttagunta et al., 2014; Belin et al., 2015; Nawabi et al., 2015; Leibinger et al., 2016; Mehta et al., 2016).\\n\\nMultiple reports have demonstrated that some regenerating RGC axons travel circuitously within the optic nerve after intraorbital crush injury (Luo et al., 2013; Pernet et al., 2013). However, these studies have used anterograde tracers that label all RGC axons, making it difficult to identify individual fibers and visualize how axons of different RGC types behave as they regenerate. Here we sought to combine sparse neuronal labeling with the immunolabeling-enabled 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO) technique (Renier et al., 2016) and trace the entire path of individual axons as they regenerate.\\n\\nRGCs are a heterogeneous population of neurons. They are divided into several subclasses based on their morphologic, physiologic, and molecular properties. Previous studies have shown that different RGC types differ in their ability to regenerate axons. For instance, studies in cats have shown that αRGCs regenerate axons better than other RGC types (Watanabe and Fukuda, 2002). Similarly, in mice it was demonstrated that αRGCs have greater propensity to regenerate axons after crush injury (Duan et al., 2015). RGCs in the Thy1-H-YFP mouse line have a “Golgi-like” labeling, allowing for the characterization of their dendrites and axons. Importantly, this line labels few RGCs, most of which are immune-positive for SMI-32, a marker of αRGCs (Feng et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2004; Coombs et al., 2006).\\n\\nIn this study, we first validate that the Thy1-H-YFP mouse sparsely labels αRGCs. We used a combination of confocal imaging and iDISCO to analyze the dendrites and axons of the labeled neurons. We find that, after optic nerve crush, (1) αRGC dendrites decrease in complexity, and the dendritic arbors are even less complex in animals treated with an axon growth promoting-stimulator (i.e., CNTF); (2) innately, axons remodel and regrow extensively proximal to the crush site; and (3) following CNTF, axon elongation is extremely circuitous, and these axons never reach the brain, despite growing distances that would allow them to reach the brain, had they grown straight. Overall, our results show that RGCs can re-extend axons very well, even in the absence of a growth stimulator, but their inability to traverse the lesion area along with meandering axon growth limit “meaningful” regeneration, dramatically reducing the number of RGCs successfully regenerating axons into the brain. Our results shift the focus from promoting axon elongation, to understanding factors that prevent direct growth of CNS axons through the injured nerve.\\n\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\nAll experimental procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Miami. The Thy1-H-YFP mouse strain was used for all experiments (The Jackson Laboratory stock number 003782). All animals were housed in a viral antigen-free facility and kept under standard 12/12 h light/dark cycle conditions. For all surgical procedures, mice where anaesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. For analgesia, buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) was administered postoperatively. The exact number of animals used for each group is in the main text and figure legends.\\n\\n\\nIntravitreal injection\\n\\nFemale and male mice six to eight weeks old underwent unilateral intravitreal adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV) injection. AAVs carried expression constructs for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; AAV-CNTF; Yungher et al., 2015) or placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) as a control transgene (AAV-PLAP). AAversus were made by the University of Miami's Viral Vector Core. Typical titers were 5 × 1012 GC/ml. A fine glass micropipette was inserted into the posterior chamber taking care to avoid damaging the lens. Using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton 80900) 2 µl of virus was slowly injected. Cholera toxin β (CTB) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (ThermoFisher C34777, 2 µg/µl in PBS) was injected as described above. CTB was injected 1 h postcrush in the 3 d postcrush (3dpc) group.\\n\\n\\nOptic nerve crush\\n\\nAnimals received unilateral optic nerve crush. Time points postcrush included in this study: 3 dpc, 3 weeks postcrush (3wpc), and 6wpc. AAV was injected 7 d before crush in the 3dpc group, or 3 d before crush in the 3wpc and 6wpc groups. For the optic nerve crush procedure, the optic nerve was exposed intra-orbitally by blunt dissection. The optic nerve was crushed with forceps (#5 Dumont, Fine Science Tools) for 10 s ∼1 mm distal to the emergence from the globe.\\n\\n\\nImmunohistochemistry\\n\\nMice were killed by transcardial perfusion with ice cold PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde. The optic nerve was cut proximal to the optic chiasm. The globe with attached optic nerve was postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C. For retinal whole mount staining, the retina was carefully dissected out of the globe and derestricting cuts were placed in each quadrant. Tissue was washed with PBS and blocked in 5% normal donkey serum (Sigma D9663) in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST). Tissue was then incubated in blocking buffer containing primary antibodies, overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies: goat-anti-osteopontin (OSPN) 1:500 (R&D Systems, AF808), rabbit-anti-melanopsin (OPN4; UF006) 1:2500 (Advanced Targeting Systems, AB-N38), goat-anti-GFP 1:1000 (Abcam, ab6673), rabbit-anti-GFP 1:1000 (Millipore, ab3080), and rabbit-anti-cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART; 55–102) 1:1000 (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, H-003-62). Following incubation with primary antibody, tissue was washed extensively in PBST. Tissue was then incubated in blocking buffer containing secondary antibodies 1:500, overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies: donkey-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher, A-21206), donkey-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (ThermoFisher, A-31573), donkey-anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher, A-11055), and donkey-anti-goat Alexa Fluor 647 (ThermoFisher, A-21447). Following secondary incubation retinas were extensive washed with PBST, mounted with Slowfade (ThermoFisher, S36973) and coverslipped. Imaging was performed on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope, objectives: UPlanSApo 10 × 0.40 N.A. and UPlanFLN 40 × 1.3 N.A., and Olympus FV10-ASW Ver 0.200C software. Images were analyzed using Imaris software (Bitplane). Figures were composed using Photoshop CS6 (Adobe) and Illustrator CS5 (Adobe).\\n\\n\\nRGC quantification\\n\\nThe number of YFP+ RGCs per retina was quantified from low-magnification z-stack images that tiled the entire retina using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope. RGCs were defined by: soma location in the ganglion cell layer or inner nuclear layer (displaced RGC), and the presence of an axon. To determine the subtype of YFP+ RGCs, every YFP+ RGC in a retina was assessed for immunoreactivity with a RGC subtype marker: OSPN, Opn4, or CART (see Results for n number of retinas assessed for each marker). Survival of YFP+ RGCs was determined as the number of YFP+ RGCs remaining or the percentage of YFP+ RGCs remaining compared to the uninjured contralateral retina. To analyze RGC dendrites, high-magnification z-stack images were taken of individual RGCs from the retinal nerve fiber layer to the inner nuclear layer. Images were tiled and reconstructed if a RGC’s dendrites extended out of field. Dendrites were traced using ImageJ/FIJI and the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin (Longair et al., 2011; Schindelin et al., 2012). Linear Sholl analysis was completed using the Sholl analysis plugin for ImageJ/FIJI (Ferreira et al., 2014). Sholl analysis data were analyzed as the average number of intersections observed in radii bins of 30 µm. Data were preprocessed using R 3.3.1 (https://cran.r-project.org/).\\n\\n\\niDISCO\\n\\nFor whole mount staining and clearing we use the enhanced version of iDISCO. For a full description of the protocol see, Renier et al. (2014), Renier et al. (2016), and website (http://lab.rockefeller.edu/tessier-lavigne/assets/file/whole-mount-staining-bench-protocol-january-2015.pdf). Dissected optic nerves were dehydrated with a methanol/PBS series, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, bleached overnight with 5% H2O2 in 100% methanol at 4°C. Rehydrated with a methanol series in PBS and 0.2% Triton X-100, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, and 0%. Incubated with 1× PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20% DMSO, and 0.3 M glycine, 37°C for 2 d. Block in 1× PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% DMSO, and 6% donkey serum, 37°C, for 2 d. Wash in 1× PBS, 0.2% Tween 20 with 10 μg/ml heparin (PTwH), room temperature for 1 h, twice. Incubate with a chicken IgY recognizing GFP epitopes (Aves, #GFP-1020, 1:200) in PTwH, 5% DMSO, and 3% donkey serum, 37°C, for 2 d. Wash in PTwH for 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, and 1 h then 2 h or longer to the next day. Incubate with a goat-anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 1:300 (ThermoFisher, A-11039) in PTwH and 3% donkey serum, 37°, 2 d. Wash in PTwH for 10, 15, 30, and 60 min each and then 2 h or longer for 2 d. After the final wash, the samples were cleared.\\n\\n\\nClearing\\n\\nWashed samples were incubated at room temperature with shaking. First, for 1 h for each step with 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% methanol in water followed by 30 min in 100% methanol twice. Next, they were incubated for 3 h in 66% dichloromethane (DCM) and 33% methanol then 20 min in 100% DCM, twice. Final clearing solution was in dibenzylether (DBE) with no shaking. Cleared optic nerves were mounted onto a cover glass with DBE and imaged on an Olympus confocal microscope (Fluoview 1000) using a 20× UPlanSApo objective (N.A. = 0.75). We used an optical zoom of 1.4× and each optic section was 1–1.2 μm. Individual stacks of images were stitched using the program XuvStitch 1.8.099x64 (http://www.xuvtools.org/doku.php).\\n\\n\\nAxon analysis\\n\\nReconstructed confocal images were analyzed using the FilamentTracer function in Imaris 8.4.1 (Bitplane). To be included in quantitative analysis an axon had to be traced from the proximal optic nerve head to its termination. An axon also had to be resolvable from surrounding axons.

We observed that there are ∼70 YFP+ RGCs in each flat-mounted retina of an adult Thy1-H-YFP mouse (n = 9 retina). While the number of YFP+ RGCs per retina varies between animals (σ = 21), there is a strong correlation (R2 = 0.9943, p < 0.05, n = 3 pairs of retina) between the left and right retina of an animal. To determine what portion of these YFP+ RGCs are αRGCs, we immunostained the retinas with an antibody against OSPN, a molecular marker of αRGCs (Duan et al., 2015; Sanes and Masland, 2015). We found that ∼70% of YFP+ RGCs are immunoreactive for OSPN (Fig. 1). To further define the molecular identity of YFP+ RGCs, we stained the retinas with antibodies against OPN4 (a marker of intrinsically photosensitive RGCs) and CART (a marker of direction selective RGCs). Very few YFP+ RGCs were immunoreactive for OPN4 (i.e., <2% of total YFP+ RGCs) or CART (i.e., <10% of total YFP+ RGCs; Fig. 1A–G). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Thy1-H-YFP mouse line sparsely labels RGCs, which are primarily OSPN+.\\n\\nFigure 1. \\nIdentification of RGC subtypes labeled by the Thy1-H-YFP mouse line. Retinal whole mount preparations were immunostained for YFP (green) and markers of three RGC subtypes (magenta): OSPN (A, D, D’), OPN4 (B, E, E’), and CART (C, F, F’).

Bar graphs of mean ± SEM (retinas: OSPN n = 9, OPN4 n = 3, and CART n = 3).\\n\\nTo examine the fate of YFP+ RGCs in response to axon injury, we performed intraorbital optic nerve crush and evaluated their survival in the presence or absence of a growth promoting factor (Fig. 2A–H,J). Six weeks postcrush, ∼13 YFP+ RGCs survived (Fig. 2J, 6wpc). Of these, ∼10 were OSPN+ RGCs, which represents ∼76% of total remaining YFP+ RGCs (Fig. 2J). Several studies have shown that virally transferred CNTF promotes RGC survival and axon regeneration. AAV2 expressing a secreted form of CNTF did not alter the survival of YFP+ and YFP+/OSPN+ RGCs (Fig. 2J, CNTF + 6wpc). These data show that the majority of surviving YFP+ RGCs in the Thy1-H-YFP mouse are αRGCs. These findings underscore the utility of the Thy1-H-YFP mouse line for studying axon regeneration in a small number of regeneration competent RGCs, and establishes the feasibility of examining how a specific RGC type will behave after injury and CNTF.\\n\\nFigure 2. Response of YFP+ RGCs to axonal injury and AAV-CNTF injection. Six weeks following optic nerve crush (6wpc), retinal whole mounts from AAV-PLAP (6wpc; A, C–E)- and AAV-CNTF (CNTF + 6wpc)-injected (B, F–H) animals were immunostained for YFP (green) and OSPN (magenta).

K–M, Uninjured n = 16 RGCs from five animals, 6wpc n = 15 RGCs from four animals, CNTF + 6wpc n = 15 RGCs from five animals).\\n\\n\\nChanges in αRGC dendrite morphology following axon injury\\n\\nIn addition to investigating the survival of YFP+ RGCs, we examined the changes in dendrite morphology following intraorbitral optic nerve crush. Again, we focused on YFP+ αRGCs (i.e., YFP+/OSPN+ RGCs). Representative images of YFP+/OSPN+ RGCs and their dendrites in uninjured and injured (6wpc) animals are shown in Figures 1D’–F’, 2C–E,I, respectively. At six weeks following injury, we did not observe a significant change in dendritic field area or the number of primary dendrites compared to uninjured animals (Fig. 2K,L). Sholl analysis, which is commonly used to evaluate dendritic field arrangement and density (Sholl, 1953), shows that there is a significant reduction in dendrite complexity following intraorbital crush (Fig. 2M, uninjured versus 6wpc, *p < 0.05). AAV-CNTF and crush injury (CNTF + 6wpc) resulted in RGCs that have fewer primary dendrites and less complex dendritic arbors than injury alone (Fig. 2K–M, #p < 0.05 6wpc vs CNTF + 6wpc; statistically significant difference detected at 30- to 90-µm radii but no other radii). Thus, these results indicate that acute optic nerve injury leads to reduction in αRGCs’ dendritic complexity, and CNTF plus injury causes an even further reduction of dendritic complexity in these neurons.\\n\\n\\nImmunohistochemical staining of unsectioned whole optic nerve using iDISCO\\n\\nTo visualize and follow single axons throughout the optic nerve, we subjected adult Thy-H-YFP mouse optic nerves to a tissue clearing procedure which renders tissues transparent and facilitates whole tissue 3D imaging. Since tissue clearing procedures generally reduce endogenous YFP signal, we also immunostained the whole nerves using an antibody against YFP before tissue clearing using the iDISCO technique Representative images of uninjured optic nerve subjected to iDISCO and whole tissue imaging are shown in Figure 3A–E. Sparsely labeled individual YFP+ RGC axons are clearly visible. These axons project linearly from the optic disk to the distal optic nerve. In rare occasions, we also noticed that some axons have a short, rapidly terminating branch (Fig. 3F,G). We also observed occasional YFP+ cells and their processes in the optic nerve. These are likely astrocytes based on their morphology (Figs. 4D, 5A; AC, yellow). We have established the use of iDISCO to visualize the entire course of Thy1-H-YFP RGC axons through the optic nerve.\\n\\nFigure 3.

Branch points marked by arrowheads. Lesion site indicated by red *.\\n\\nNext, we used iDISCO to evaluate how individual axons within a defined population of RGCs regenerate. To determine the validity of our method, we compared the number of RGCs to the number of axons in the optic nerve for five animals. Consistent with the number of YFP+ RGCs in the retina, there were ∼70 axons in each nerve. Furthermore, we find a strong correlation between the number of RGCs and axons (R2 = 0.9975, p < 0.0001, n = 5 retina, optic nerve pairs; Fig. 3H), and on average we identified 98.5% of the axons predicted by the number of YFP+ RGCs. These data indicate that we can identify all YFP+ axons within the optic nerve.\\n\\n\\nAnalysis of single YFP+ RGC axons following optic nerve injury\\n\\nTo examine the morphology and growth pattern of YFP+ RGC axons following crush injury, first we collected Thy1-H-YFP mouse optic nerves 3dpc and performed iDISCO and 3D confocal imaging (Fig. 4B,C). To determine how an individual axon regenerates, we traced entire axons of some RGCs (Fig. 4B,C). Additionally, to visualize all RGC axons, CTB conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 was injected 1 h after crush to label axons anterogradely. Even at this early stage (i.e., 3dpc; Fig. 4C, n = 4), some axons regrew within a small area near the cut end. However, there were no axons beyond the lesion site. Axons in the animals subjected to AAV-CNTF and crush injury (CNTF + 3dpc, n = 4) appear similar at this time point (Fig. 4B). Disconnected YFP+ axons which have not yet undergone Wallerian degeneration are visible distal to the lesion site (Fig. 4B,C, arrows indicate disconnected bulbs). All YFP+ axons are clearly disconnected, and no CTB labeled axons are found far distal to the lesion site (i.e., 1 mm distal to lesion site), strongly indicating that the injury is complete and no axons are spared from axotomy. These results show that some YFP+ axons begin growing soon after injury (3dpc). Notably, this initial growth appears independent to the presence of CNTF.\\n\\nSecond, we observed the growth pattern of YFP+ axons at an intermediate time point. At 3wpc, YFP+ axons in AAV-CNTF-treated animals (CNTF + 3wpc, n = 4 animals) regrew within regions proximal to the lesion site, forming complex branched and looped structures. Some axons also grew past the lesion site (Fig. 4D).\\n\\nTo further investigate this complex growth pattern, we examined axon regeneration at six weeks after injury. Optic nerves from four individual animals (6wpc 1–4) are shown in Figure 5. At six weeks postinjury (6wpc), nearly all surviving YFP+ RGC axons were limited to the region proximal to crush site, consistent with the limited ability of CNS axons to regenerate beyond the injury site. We note that the proximal edge of the lesion site occurs at ∼1 mm (±0.2 mm) away from the optic disk. In one animal, we observed one YPF+ axon past the lesion site, elongating to ∼1 mm away from the lesion site (Fig. 5A, 6wpc 4). However, we did not observe regenerating YFP+ RGC axons far beyond the lesion site (i.e., 3 mm from the lesion), indicating that the crush injury was complete and did not leave axons spared.\\n\\nFigure 6. iDISCO based 3D analysis of YFP+ axons six weeks following AAV-CNTF injection and optic nerve crush (CNTF + 6wpc). A, Maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of full thickness optic nerves showing YFP+ axons (white). Lesion site indicated by red *. Orientation, optic nerve head on left, distal toward the optic chiasm to the right. Four optic nerves were members of this group, CNTF + 6wpc 1–4. Only animals CNTF + 6wpc 1–3 had axons that could be fully traced and were included in the quantification. Traces for YFP+ axons are shown with MIP image. Each color represents an individual axon.

Uninjured n = 34 axons from three animals, 6wpc n = 42 axons from four animals, CNTF + 6wpc n = 22 axons from three animals (CNTF + 6wpc 1–3).\\n\\nFinally, we examined the response of YFP+ RGC axons six weeks following optic nerve crush when the animals received AAV-CNTF injection. Previous studies have demonstrated that CNTF allows some RGC axons to regenerate long distances in the optic nerve with some axons reaching the brain (Pernet et al., 2013; Yungher et al., 2015). We injected AAV-CNTF 3 d before unilateral crush, and we collected Thy1-H-YFP mouse optic nerves at six weeks after injury. Injured optic nerves from four individual animals are shown in Figures 6A, 7. Three of the four animals (CNTF + 6wpc 1–3) had axons that could be traced in their entirety. The fourth had extensive aberrant growth that prevented the tracing of each axon with certainty (Fig. 7B, CNTF + 6wpc 4); however, many axon segments could be traced effectively.\\n\\nFigure 7. iDISCO based 3D visualization of aberrant axon growth. A, Axon traces from animal CNTF + 6wpc 3 are shown from three perspectives. CNTF + 6wpc 3 and CNTF + 6wpc 3’ show longitudinal views of the same optic nerve. CNTF + 6wpc 3’’ and CNTF + 6wpc 4’’’ show coronal views of the optic nerve. B, Animal CNTF + 6wpc 4. Continuous axon segments that could be traced with a high degree of certainty are shown. Each color represents a continuous segment. Lesion site indicated by red *. Arrowheads mark the three segments that grew beyond the lesion site. Scale bars, 100 µm.\\n\\nTracing each axon in its entirety allows comprehensive axon pattern analysis. We observed that axon branching occurs frequently following crush. Approximately half of the axons have 1 or more branches (Fig. 6B, 6wpc). AAV-CNTF significantly increased the number of axons with branches (p < 0.05) and the number of branches per axon (p = 0.0001; Fig. 6B, 6wpc vs CNTF + 6wpc). Next, we sought to characterize for each axon (1) total axon length, (2) how far centrally an axon reached (maximum distance achieved from the optic disk), and (3) how much aberrant growth occurred (aberrant growth = axon total length – maximum distance achieved; Fig. 6C–E). Given that the proximal edge of the crush site is ∼1 mm from the optic disk, we see that most axons in the injury control animals remain within or near the lesion site (i.e., within 0.8–1.2 mm from the optic disk). Surprisingly, even in the absence of growth promoting factors many of these axons grew (Figs. 5B, 6C\\n). This growth was mostly within the region proximal to the crush. Some axons grew between 1 and 2 mm in length. This growth consists of branches and loops, growth that does not extend the axon distally along the optic nerve (Figs. 5B, 6E). Together, these results show that YFP+ RGCs are innately capable of regrowing long axons; however, these axons are unable to successfully traverse the lesion.\\n\\nConsistent with the regeneration promoting effects of CNTF, axons grew significantly longer than controls (Fig. 6C, p < 0.001). Like the injured control animals, many axons failed to grow through the lesion site, and most regrowth was aberrant (Fig. 6E). In CNTF animals, the axon length measurement shows that despite growing >4–5 mm, some axons are restricted to the lesion area. Independent of treatment, the maximum distance along the optic nerve most growing axons achieve is associated with the lesion site, around 1000 µm from the optic disk (Fig. 6D, distance of lesion site from optic disk indicated as horizontal reference line at 1000 µm). In fact, the median maximum distance achieved by axons in CNTF animals was only 25% longer than that of the control injured animals despite the fact that the CNTF axons grew 3- to 4-fold longer in total length (Fig. 6C–E). Figure 7A shows reconstructed axons of the CNTF + 6wpc 3 optic nerve from different viewing angles. This pattern of regrowth was also evident in the fourth animal (Fig. 7B, CNTF + 6wpc 4). While we were unable to trace each axon from the optic nerve head to termination, we determined that no more than three axons grew beyond the lesion site (Fig. 7B, arrowheads). As shown in the cross view of the optic nerve (Fig. 7, images in the right panels), some axons wrap around the nerve several rounds, further illustrating the extensiveness of tortuous growth.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nRGCs of different subtypes are connected to distinct presynaptic partners and exhibit an array of responses to visual stimuli. RGCs of different subtypes also project their axons to different brain targets and contribute to image-forming functions as well as non-imaging forming functions (Sanes and Masland, 2015) Anatomically, how do the dendrites and axons of specific RGC types respond to axotomy, as well as after treatments with factors that stimulate axon growth? In the retina, several studies have characterized RGC type-specific changes in dendrite morphology after traumatic axotomy or in glaucoma models. As such, changes in dendrites after insult have been described to some extent. However, the abilities of specific RGC types to regenerate axons and correctly find their targets in adult mammals are just beginning to be determined. Since some studies have shown that many regenerating RGC axons grow circuitously near the lesion and fail to regenerate far, we sought to combine sparse neuronal labeling with iDISCO and follow individual axons derived primarily from one RGC type; αRGC. The major observations in this study are (1) αRGC dendrites decrease their complexity following axotomy, and this response to axotomy is exacerbated by CNTF treatment; (2) YPF+ RGC axons grow over unexpectedly long distances before the lesion site with only a few axons being able to successfully traverse the lesion; and (3) YFP+ axons that do regenerate beyond the lesion site elongate aberrantly, form many collateral axons in the optic nerve and fail to reach the brain.\\n\\n\\nConsiderations for cell types of origin of the YFP+ processes\\n\\nOur results show that the majority of surviving YFP+ RGCs after injury are immunoreactive for OSPN, indicating that most of these YFP+ RGCs belong to αRGCs (Duan et al., 2015; Sanes and Masland, 2015). Together with the observation that αRGCs have higher capacity to regenerate axons compared to other RGCs in general (Watanabe and Fukuda, 2002; Duan et al., 2015), we reason that the majority of YFP+ RGC axons that we analyzed are likely to be of αRGCs. However, because 24% of surviving RGCs are OSPN-negative (i.e., of the 13 surviving YFP+ RGCs per retina, 10 are YFP+/OSPN+ and 3 are YFP+/OSPN−), we are unable to conclusively determine if the axons that grew beyond the lesion site are of αRGC origin.\\n\\n\\nChanges in αRGC dendrites in responses to axotomy and CNTF\\n\\nUsing transgenic mice that label defined RGC types, previous studies have examined the morphologic changes that occur in RGC dendrites. In a mouse glaucoma model, OFF transient RGCs showed decreased dendritic arborization (Della Santina et al., 2013). Similarly, the dendritic complexity of transient OFF αRGCs from glaucomatous mouse eyes is reduced (El-Danaf and Huberman, 2015). Thus, the results in our study showing loss of dendritic complexity in αRGCs are in line with these previous reports. In contrast, in adult rats, peripheral nerve graft and AAV-CNTF cause an increase in soma size of RGCs without affecting the dendritic complexity or field size (Rodger et al., 2012). However, when examined specifically in the RGC 1 subtype (i.e., RGCs with a large soma), AAV-CNTF caused a significant reduction in the complexity of the dendritic arbors, again without reducing the field size (Rodger et al., 2012). In line with the previous study, our results show that AAV-CNTF leads to a significant decrease in arbor complexity without altering the dendritic field size in most cells. Thus, our results suggest that while αRGC axons are highly regenerative and quite likely generate complex arbors (i.e., in response to CNTF), their dendrites become less complex. In this regard, one could ask why and how does CNTF cause even greater reduction in dendrite complexity in these RGCs? The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying such different behaviors by the axons and dendrites are unknown. It is also unclear whether the reduction in dendrite arbor complexity will be potentially disruptive for the function of these RGCs (i.e., receive less input from their presynaptic partners). These are interesting questions that may deserve further investigation.\\n\\nWe observed that the majority of YFP-labeled αRGCs (∼80%) in this experimental example died at six weeks after injury. Currently, it is unclear whether these YFP+ αRGCs die long after injury because of lack of intrinsic survival signals or because they are disconnected for a long time and lack trophic support from the target. It is also possible that they die because they remain unmyelinated (i.e., not remyelinated) for a long period time, lacking the survival signal(s) and other type(s) of support from the oligodendrocytes (or even astrocytes). The question why most RGCs die remains nebulous and justifies further investigation.\\n\\n\\nHighly regenerative yet unable to go far\\n\\nSeveral prior studies have adopted tissue clearing strategies and examined axon regeneration in unsectioned, whole CNS tissues (Ertürk et al., 2011; Laskowski and Bradke, 2013; Luo et al., 2013; Pernet et al., 2013; Soderblom et al., 2015). In this study, we sought to expand the 3D analysis to track single axons in given neuronal types. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report the adaptation of sparse labeling and whole tissue staining to attain the entire projection profiles of regenerating axons. Perhaps the most striking observation in our study was the extensive and circuitous regeneration of RGC axons occurring proximal to the lesion site. Axons start to penetrate through the lesion, sometime more than once, but each time they turn back toward the retina and thus they elongate within the proximal optic nerve region (i.e., near the optic nerve head). Additionally, axons that surpass the lesion continue to branch and misroute, with these events lacking an obvious spatial pattern (e.g., occurring near the lesion site). We also note that none of these axons grew past the optic chiasm. As can be seen in Figures 4–7, regenerating axons stop at different distances away from the chiasm. Previous studies have suggested that optic chiasm may inhibit or halt some axons to grow further (Luo et al., 2013; Crair and Mason, 2016). At least for these neurons however, the reason that they fail to grow past the chiasm does not seem to be due to chiasmatic barrier as these axons terminate or turn toward the eye even before they get close to the optic chiasm.\\n\\nHow does an axon successfully traverse the lesion? In the CNS lesion, various growth inhibitory molecules are present. Molecular barriers within the lesion area include chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and myelin-associated inhibitors (Yiu and He, 2006). Astrocytes and fibroblasts interact to establish a scar, surrounding the lesion. Therefore, to successfully traverse the lesion, a growing axon will need to modify the extracellular matrix (ECM) and overcome inhibitory/repulsive cues. Differential expression of ECM modifying enzymes and cell surface receptors may explain why some axons never cross the lesion while others do. This simple explanation is challenged by our finding that axons proximal to the lesion form extensive branches and loops and then eventually grow through the lesion (i.e., Fig. 6A, CNTF + 6wpc 1). For this to occur, axons would need to be dynamically responsive to their environment and alter gene expression accordingly (i.e., after failing to traverse the lesion, they change expression of certain molecules to better suit the lesion environment), or crossing the lesion site is a stochastic event. Future investigation will be needed to identify if specific RGCs are can cross the lesion barrier, and what interventions can help axons through this environment.\\n\\nThe tracing of individual axons allowed us to measure the total length of individual axons as well as the maximum distances from the eye. Unequivocally, we find that while many axons travel long distances, their circuitous growth results in them remaining within close vicinity to the lesion site. The observation that the regenerating axons grow aberrantly within the optic nerve is mostly in agreement with previous studies (Luo et al., 2013; Pernet et al., 2013). Nonetheless, our current study provides a complete picture of individual axon trajectory, from their entry into the optic nerve to the end of their route. This is particularly the case for the portion of axons located in the proximal area to the injury site which was not possible in the previous studies that have used CTB as a tracer for all RGC axons. Overall, our results build on prior studies and further show that the growth of YFP+ RGCs axons are tortuous in their paths, and that these axons are unlikely to reinnervate their brain targets after CNTF treatment.\\n\\n\\nQuestion of treatment and cell type-specific axon behaviors\\n\\nCNTF is only one of many factors that can induce axon regeneration. Do different regeneration stimulating factors cause a similar degree of aberrant growth and misrouting? Do the axons of all RGC types have similar propensity to misroute? Studies by Lim et al. (2016), and de Lima et al. (2012), showed that at least under certain conditions, some RGC axons are able to regenerate with minimal misrouting and back to their correct targets. In some instances, these RGC axons seem to travel linearly toward the brain (Lim et al., 2016). It appears that under some conditions, RGC axons may be able to navigate through the injured optic nerve. It is unknown what molecular and cellular factors minimize misrouting and produce directed growth within the optic nerve and beyond. It may be interesting to apply 3D analysis and examine the behavior of αRGCs and other RGC types under additional growth-promoting conditions. This could help determine if the aberrant growth seen in the present study is specific to some RGC types or to CNTF treatment per se.\\n\\nIt is known that certain types of neurons in different CNS regions including the supraspinal serotonergic neurons are able to spontaneously remodel and reextend axons after axotomy (Hawthorne et al., 2011). On the other hand, other neurons including the corticospinal tract axons are strongly refractory to regeneration where the cut dystrophic axons regress with virtually no signs of regrowth (Thallmair et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2010). In the case of RGCs, we know from studies using CTB tracing that a few of these neurons can spontaneously regrow axons, at least to some short distance into the lesion. The lengthy axons seen even without CNTF in our study indicate that RGCs (and perhaps other CNS neurons) may have much higher growth capacity than generally thought. In the case of peripheral neurons, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons send collaterals and misroute following injury to the central branch (Kerschensteiner et al., 2005). It would be interesting to determine if this aberrant growth of DRG axons is amplified following preconditioning injury, a method to promote regeneration of a DRG’s central branch.\\n\\nThese findings highlight the need for prudence when evaluating a growth factor to promote axon regeneration. CNTF and other growth factors are frequently used in regeneration studies to stimulate axon growth. In our study, CNTF produced abundant axon growth, but this growth was highly aberrant. Thus, this growth factor caused “too much of a good thing.” Therefore, future treatments must be adjusted to maximize axon growth into brain targets, and minimize axon branching and tortuous growth.\\n\\nOverall, our study documents the morphologic changes that occur in αRGCs after optic nerve injury. Tracking the entire paths of individual axons reveal that these RGCs can naturally re-extend axons extremely well, but both their inability to traverse the lesion area and their circuitous axon growth limit reconnection with the brain. Our results counter the general view that RGC axons are incapable of lengthy regeneration, and shift the focus from promoting axon elongation, to understanding factors that prevent direct growth of axons through the injured nerve.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': '3D Visualization of Individual Regenerating Retinal Ganglion Cell Axons Reveals Surprisingly Complex Growth Paths', 'journal_title': 'eNeuro'}\n",

Furthermore, spontaneous seizures and cognitive dysfunction after AS activity are often intense in the aged population than in young adults. This could be due to an increased vulnerability of inhibitory interneurons in the aged hippocampus to AS activity. We investigated this issue by comparing the survival of hippocampal GABA-ergic interneurons that contain the neuropeptide Y (NPY) or the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) between young adult (5-months old) and aged (22-months old) F344 rats at 12 days after three-hours of AS activity. Graded intraperitoneal injections of the kainic acid (KA) induced AS activity and a diazepam injection at 3 hours after the onset terminated AS-activity. Measurement of interneuron numbers in different hippocampal subfields revealed that NPY&#x0002b; interneurons were relatively resistant to AS activity in the aged hippocampus in comparison to the young adult hippocampus. Whereas, PV&#x0002b; interneurons were highly susceptible to AS activity in both age groups. However, as aging alone substantially depleted these populations, the aged hippocampus after three-hours of AS activity exhibited 48&#x00025; reductions in NPY&#x0002b; interneurons and 70&#x00025; reductions in PV&#x0002b; interneurons, in comparison to the young hippocampus after similar AS activity. Thus, AS activity-induced TLE in old age is associated with far fewer hippocampal NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneuron numbers than AS-induced TLE in the young adult age. This discrepancy likely underlies the severe spontaneous seizures and cognitive dysfunction observed in the aged people after AS activity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count=\"10\"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id=\"s1\"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epilepsy, characterized by intermittent and unpredictable occurrence of seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Engel1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[1]</xref> and over two million people in the United States <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Faught1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, more than a third of epileptic patients are over 65 years of age, as old age is the most common time for presenting seizures <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hauser1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Wallace1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[5]</xref>.

From this perspective, the survival and connectivity of inhibitory interneurons in the aged hippocampus have received notice. Interneurons in the hippocampus are gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) expressing non-principal neurons distributed in different strata of the dentate gyrus (DG), and the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields. Inhibitory input from various subpopulations of GABA-ergic interneurons to principal neurons in different subfields of the hippocampus serves to keep the network stability <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Freund1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[12]</xref>. Any disinhibition of the principal excitatory neurons due to compromised inhibitory input from the GABA-ergic interneurons leads to hyperexcitability <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Franck1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Buzsaki1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[15]</xref>. Likewise, GABA agonists suppress seizures, GABA antagonists and drugs that inhibit GABA synthesis induce seizures, and drugs that increase synaptic GABA are potent anticonvulsants <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Treiman1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[16]</xref>. Thus, maintenance of a critical number of GABA-synthesizing interneurons in different subfields of the hippocampus appears essential for stabilizing excitatory influences and synchronizing principal excitatory neuron populations in the hippocampus <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Freund1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[12]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Buzsaki1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The interneuron population in the hippocampus is vulnerable to changes such as aging and excitotoxic hippocampal injury. Previous studies have demonstrated that aging leads to decreased numbers of GABA-ergic interneurons in all subfields of the hippocampus <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Shetty1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Shetty2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[22]</xref>. These findings indicate that decreased numbers of GABA-ergic interneurons have a role in the increased excitability of principal neurons in the aged hippocampus. A reduced functional inhibition observed in the aging hippocampus <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Luebke1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[23]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Potier1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[24]</xref> also supports the above possibility. Thus, circuitry in the aged hippocampus appears to be pro-excitatory and most vulnerable to conditions such as epilepsy. Indeed, the aged hippocampus exhibits an increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures after injury or exposure to excitotoxins <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Liang1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>. Moreover, acute seizure (AS) activity in old age has an increased tendency for evolving into chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and cognitive dysfunction that ensue after AS activity are frequently intense in the aged population than in young adults <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>. Other studies have also shown an increased vulnerability of the aged population for developing TLE after brain damage resulting from stroke or head injury <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-LaRoche1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[29]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Leppik1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[30]</xref>. In this context, an increased vulnerability of inhibitory GABA-ergic interneurons in the aged hippocampus to AS activity cannot be ruled out, though a recent study suggested resistance of GABA-ergic interneurons in the aged hippocampus to a focal excitotoxic injury <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Shetty2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[22]</xref>.</p><p>To address the above issue, we compared the survival of subpopulations of hippocampal GABA-ergic interneurons that express the neuropeptide Y (NPY) or the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) between the young adult (5-months old) and aged (22-months old) F344 rats following three-hours of AS activity. Graded intraperitoneal injections of the kainic acid (KA) were performed to generate AS activity, and AS activity was terminated using a diazepam injection at three hours after its onset. The NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneurons in the dentate gyrus, and the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the young adult and aged hippocampi, were measured at 12 days after AS activity through a stereological method and compared with counts from the hippocampi of age-matched intact animals. The selection of NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneurons for quantification in this study is based on the following reasons. The NPY is an endogenous anticonvulsant, and has a role in learning, memory and mood functions and hippocampal neurogenesis <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Howell1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[31]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Sperk1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[32]</xref>.

This was evidenced by the following observations. In comparison to the age-matched intact hippocampus, the overall diminution in the number of NPY&#x0002b; interneurons after three-hour AS activity was substantial in the young adult hippocampus (42&#x00025; reduction) but insignificant in the aged hippocampus (17&#x00025; reduction). Additional subfield-specific quantification uncovered that AS activity induced loss of NPY&#x0002b; interneurons in young adult rats was significant for the dentate gyrus and the CA3 subfield. In aged rats, it was significant only for the dentate gyrus. On the other hand, the overall decline in the number of PV&#x0002b; interneurons after the three hours of AS activity was highly significant in both young adult hippocampus (60&#x00025; reduction) and the aged hippocampus (82&#x00025; reduction). Subfield-specific analyses revealed that AS activity induced loss of PV&#x0002b; interneurons was considerable for all three regions of the hippocampus in both young adult and aged rats. Thus, in the aged hippocampus, the NPY&#x0002b; interneurons are largely resistant to AS activity whereas PV&#x0002b; interneurons are particularly vulnerable to AS activity. Interestingly, despite the above discrepancy in vulnerability between the two interneuron populations, residual numbers of both NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneurons in the hippocampus of aged rats that underwent AS activity were much lower (48&#x00025; lower for NPY&#x0002b; interneurons and 70&#x00025; lower for PV&#x0002b; interneurons) than their counterparts in the hippocampus of young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity. This is mainly because of significant reductions in the numbers of NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneurons with aging alone.</p><sec id=\"s3a\"><title>Potential reasons for differential sensitivity of NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneurons to AS activity in the aged hippocampus</title><p>A reduced vulnerability of NPY&#x0002b; interneurons in the aged hippocampus is not due to a reduced number of seizures in the aged rats during the period of AS activity. This is because, seizure analyses during the three-hours of AS activity performed in these rats and reported earlier revealed no differences between the two age groups for the numbers of stage III or stage V seizures but increased numbers of stage IV seizures in aged rats <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>. Moreover, the discrepancy is also not due to a reduced hippocampal principal neuron loss in aged rats after AS activity because aged rats exhibited similar neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation as the young adult rats after AS activity except for the hippocampal CA1 region where aged rats exhibited much greater level of neurodegeneration <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>. On the other hand, a greater sensitivity of the PV&#x0002b; interneurons to AS activity observed in both age groups could be because the PV&#x0002b; interneurons being the fast-spiking interneurons have greater susceptibility to AS activity <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Weiss1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[39]</xref>. Another possibility is that the residual PV&#x0002b; interneurons in the aged hippocampus have a greater level of afferent synaptic connectivity with principal hippocampal neurons (such as dentate granule cells, and CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons) than NPY&#x0002b; interneurons. Furthermore, aging may be associated with differential changes in the intrinsic properties of hippocampal interneurons expressing NPY and PV such as a reduced excitability in NPY&#x0002b; interneurons and a greater excitability in PV&#x0002b; interneurons following afferent stimulation due to differential changes in glutamate or other receptors that promote excitatory neurotransmission in these interneurons. Additionally, it may be that the firing of principal neurons in the aged hippocampus during AS activity is not strong enough to cause widespread degeneration of NPY&#x0002b; interneuron numbers but adequate for inducing degeneration of fast-spiking PV&#x0002b; interneurons. Indeed, a previous study showed that while both young and aged rats exhibited an increase in the EEG power during the AS activity, visual inspection and spectral analysis revealed a reduction of the faster frequencies in the EEGs of aged animals despite a shorter latency to stage V seizures in comparison to young rats <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Darbin1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[40]</xref>. It is conceivable that a reduced EEG activity in aged animals is sufficient for inducing degeneration of significant numbers of hippocampal principal neurons and PV&#x0002b; interneurons but not NPY&#x0002b; interneurons. Further studies are required to recognize the contribution of above possibilities to the relative resistance of NPY&#x0002b; interneurons in the aged hippocampus to AS activity.</p></sec><sec id=\"s3b\"><title>Implications of reduced numbers of NPY&#x0002b; interneurons in the aged hippocampus after AS activity</title><p>In the hippocampus, the NPY&#x0002b; inhibitory GABA-ergic interneurons are mainly distributed in the dentate hilus and the CA1 and CA3 strata oriens and pyramidale <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Freund1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[12]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[38]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Milner1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[41]</xref>.

Third, NPY has a role in the hippocampal neurogenesis and functions such as learning, memory and mood, as it enhances the proliferation of neural stem cells and augments the mitogenic effect of the fibroblast growth factor-2 on neural stem cells <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Howell1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[31]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Sperk1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[32]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Rodrigo1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[50]</xref>.</p><p>From the above, it appears that considerably decreased number of NPY&#x0002b; interneurons observed in both young adult and aged hippocampi after AS activity plays a role in the progression of AS activity into chronic epilepsy and cognitive dysfunction. However, as the overall number of residual NPY&#x0002b; neurons in the aged hippocampus after AS activity is 48&#x00025; fewer than the young adult hippocampus after similar AS activity, the implications of reduced NPY levels on hippocampal functions are likely much greater in aged animals. These may include significantly decreased inhibition of hippocampal excitatory neurons resulting in widespread epileptiform activity and spontaneous seizures, and vastly decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and severely impaired hippocampal-dependent learning and memory function. Indeed, our earlier report has shown that aged rats exhibit much greater propensity for developing TLE characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures after 3 hours of AS activity than young adult rats undergoing similar AS activity <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, the overall intensity and severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures in the chronic phase after AS activity were much greater in aged rats than in young adult rats <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>. Additionally, aged rats that underwent 3 hours of AS activity were incapable of learning a spatial task in a water maze test whereas young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity exhibited capacity for spatial learning but had memory dysfunction <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id=\"s3c\"><title>Implications of substantially reduced PV&#x0002b; interneuron numbers in the aged hippocampus after AS activity</title><p>In the hippocampus, PV&#x0002b; inhibitory GABA-ergic interneurons are typically observed in the dentate granule cell layer (as basket cells), and the strata oriens and pyramidale of CA1&#x02013;CA3 subfields <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Celio1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[51]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Kosaka1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[52]</xref>. The calcium binding protein PV&#x0002b; interneurons have crucial functions in the hippocampus. First, these fast-spiking interneurons are a prime source of perisomatic inhibition onto hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the CA1&#x02013;CA3 regions <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Freund1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[12]</xref>. Second, the activity of PV&#x0002b; interneurons is essential for maintaining the working memory function of the hippocampus, as selective ablation of PV&#x0002b; interneurons in the CA1 subfield induces spatial working memory impairments <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Murray1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[53]</xref>. Third, the activity of PV&#x0002b; interneurons is necessary for synchronizing the hippocampal pyramidal neurons during network oscillations <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Klausberger1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[34]</xref>. Because hippocampal network oscillations coordinate the firing of large neuronal populations at different time scales and maintain conditions for adaptive operation of networks during data encoding, processing and storage, the PV&#x0002b; interneurons have functional relevance for contributing to cognitive processes handled by the hippocampus <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Korotkova1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[54]</xref>. Fourth, reductions in the PV&#x0002b; interneuron subpopulation can be a key factor in the epileptogenic process, as PV deficiency affects network properties resulting in an increased susceptibility to seizures <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Schwaller1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[35]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Andrioli1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[36]</xref>. Our results show that, three hours of AS activity results in a substantial loss of PV&#x0002b; interneurons in all regions of the hippocampus in both young adult and aged rats. The findings in young adult rats are consistent with the earlier reports on epileptic hippocampal tissues from TLE patients and animal models of TLE <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Gruber1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[55]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Sundstrom1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[58]</xref>.

Because of a substantial loss suffered during the process of aging and a relatively greater loss in response to AS activity, the aged rats that underwent AS activity exhibit 70&#x00025; lower PV&#x0002b; interneurons than the young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity. From this perspective, it is likely that extensively decreased PV&#x0002b; interneuron numbers in the aged hippocampus after AS activity contribute significantly to impairments in the various hippocampal functions described earlier <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id=\"s3d\"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that the vulnerability of NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneurons to three hours of AS activity in the aged hippocampus is distinct. While the NPY&#x0002b; interneurons in the aged hippocampus were relatively resistant, the PV&#x0002b; interneurons were highly susceptible to AS activity. Nonetheless, the residual numbers of both NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneurons in the hippocampus of aged rats that underwent AS activity were much lower, in comparison to their counterparts in the hippocampus of young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity. This is mainly because of significant reductions in the numbers of NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneurons with aging alone. Overall, these results underscore that AS activity-induced TLE in old age is linked with far fewer hippocampal NPY&#x0002b; and PV&#x0002b; interneuron numbers than AS-induced TLE in the young adult age. This discrepancy likely underlies the much severe spontaneous seizures and cognitive dysfunction observed in the aged population after AS activity <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\" id=\"s4\"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Four groups of Fischer 344 (F344) rats obtained from the National Institutes of Aging colony at Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study.

The KA injections were terminated when rats displayed either a state of continuous stage IV seizures characterized by bilateral forelimb clonus with signs of rearing, or a first stage V seizure typified by bilateral forelimb clonus with rearing and falling followed by continuous stages III-V seizures for over 10 minutes.

Both groups of rats were allowed to have multiple stages III-V seizures after the onset of SE. However, after three hours of AS activity, all motor seizures were terminated with a single injection of diazepam (5 mg/Kg body weight [bw]). Despite the differing doses of KA required for induction of SE and AS activity, the severity of AS activity in terms of stages III-V seizures during a three-hour period were largely comparable between the two age groups <xref rid=\"pone.0024493-Hattiangady1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id=\"s4b\"><title>Animal perfusions and tissue processing</title><p>Twelve days after the three hours of AS activity, surviving rats from both groups (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5/group) were fatally anesthetized with isoflurane.

Thirty-micrometer thick cryostat sections were cut coronally through the entire septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus and collected serially in 24-well plates filled with PB.

Cells that are positive for NPY/PV in each of the three selected regions were counted from 50&#x02013;500 frames chosen via a systematic random sampling procedure in every 20th section using a 100X oil immersion lens. A counting frame measuring 40&#x000d7;40 &#x000b5;m was used for all three regions (the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 subfields). For counting of cells in each section, the contours of different regions (the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 subfields) were first delineated using the tracing function of the StereoInvestigator. Following this, the optical fractionator unit was activated and the number and location of counting frames and the counting depth for each section was determined by entering parameters such as the grid size, the thickness of the top guard zone (4 &#x000b5;m) and the optical dissector height (8 &#x000b5;m). A computer controlled motorized stage then allowed the section to be analyzed at each of the counting frame locations. All NPY&#x0002b;/PV&#x0002b; interneurons that were present within the 8 &#x000b5;m section depths in each location were counted. The above procedure was repeated for all serial sections. An option in the Stereo Investigator program allowed the experimenter to remain unaware of the running cell count totals until all sections for an animal were completed. The StereoInvestigator program then calculated the total number of NPY&#x0002b;/PV&#x0002b; interneurons per each region by utilizing the optical fractionator formula, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1/ssf.1/asf.1/hsf.EQ-. The abbreviation ssf represents the section sampling fraction, which was 20 in this study, as every 20th section was sampled. asf symbolizes the area sampling fraction, which was calculated by dividing the area sampled with the total area of the respective subfield (i.e. the sum of subfield areas sampled in every 20th section). hsf stands for the height sampling fraction, which was calculated by dividing the height sampled (i.e. 8 &#x000b5;m in this study) with the section thickness at the time of analysis (i.e. 20 &#x000b5;m in intact control animals and 15 &#x000b5;m in animals that underwent 3 hours of AS activity).

occurrence of seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide [1] and over two million people in the United States [2]. Furthermore, more than a third of epileptic patients are over 65 years of age, as old age is the most common time for presenting seizures [3]–[5]. This may be due to an increased excitability of principal hippocampal neurons seen with age [6]−[11]. From this perspective, the survival and connectivity of inhibitory interneurons in the aged hippocampus have received notice. Interneurons in the hippocampus are gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) expressing non-principal neurons distributed in different strata of the dentate gyrus (DG), and the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields. Inhibitory input from various subpopulations of GABA-ergic interneurons to principal neurons in different subfields of the hippocampus serves to keep the network stability [12]. Any disinhibition of the principal excitatory neurons due to compromised inhibitory input from the GABA-ergic interneurons leads to hyperexcitability [13]–[15]. Likewise, GABA agonists suppress seizures, GABA antagonists and drugs that inhibit GABA synthesis induce seizures, and drugs that increase synaptic GABA are potent anticonvulsants [16]. Thus, maintenance of a critical number of GABA-synthesizing interneurons in different subfields of the hippocampus appears essential for stabilizing excitatory influences and synchronizing principal excitatory neuron populations in the hippocampus [12], [15].\\n\\nThe interneuron population in the hippocampus is vulnerable to changes such as aging and excitotoxic hippocampal injury. Previous studies have demonstrated that aging leads to decreased numbers of GABA-ergic interneurons in all subfields of the hippocampus [17]–[22]. These findings indicate that decreased numbers of GABA-ergic interneurons have a role in the increased excitability of principal neurons in the aged hippocampus. A reduced functional inhibition observed in the aging hippocampus [23], [24] also supports the above possibility. Thus, circuitry in the aged hippocampus appears to be pro-excitatory and most vulnerable to conditions such as epilepsy. Indeed, the aged hippocampus exhibits an increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures after injury or exposure to excitotoxins [25]–[28]. Moreover, acute seizure (AS) activity in old age has an increased tendency for evolving into chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) [28]. Furthermore, spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and cognitive dysfunction that ensue after AS activity are frequently intense in the aged population than in young adults [28]. Other studies have also shown an increased vulnerability of the aged population for developing TLE after brain damage resulting from stroke or head injury [29], [30]. In this context, an increased vulnerability of inhibitory GABA-ergic interneurons in the aged hippocampus to AS activity cannot be ruled out, though a recent study suggested resistance of GABA-ergic interneurons in the aged hippocampus to a focal excitotoxic injury [22].\\n\\nTo address the above issue, we compared the survival of subpopulations of hippocampal GABA-ergic interneurons that express the neuropeptide Y (NPY) or the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) between the young adult (5-months old) and aged (22-months old) F344 rats following three-hours of AS activity. Graded intraperitoneal injections of the kainic acid (KA) were performed to generate AS activity, and AS activity was terminated using a diazepam injection at three hours after its onset. The NPY+ and PV+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus, and the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the young adult and aged hippocampi, were measured at 12 days after AS activity through a stereological method and compared with counts from the hippocampi of age-matched intact animals. The selection of NPY+ and PV+ interneurons for quantification in this study is based on the following reasons. The NPY is an endogenous anticonvulsant, and has a role in learning, memory and mood functions and hippocampal neurogenesis [31], [32]. Furthermore, the NPY+ interneurons in the dentate hilus play a crucial role in inhibiting the activity of hippocampal circuitry but more vulnerable to AS activity [33]. The PV+ interneurons contribute to synchronizing the hippocampal network oscillations [34]. Additionally, reductions in the PV+ interneuron subpopulation are thought to be a key factor in the epileptogenic process, as PV deficiency affects network properties resulting in an increased susceptibility to seizures [35], [36].\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nSurvival of NPY+ hippocampal interneurons following three-hours of AS activity\\n\\nImmunohistochemical staining of sections with a NPY antibody clearly demonstrated the prevalence of NPY+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 subfields of both young and aged intact control rats (Figs 1 and 2 [A1]). The NPY+ neurons were prominent in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (Figs. 1 and 2 [A2]) and the strata oriens and pyramidale of the CA1 and CA3 regions (Figs. 1 and 2 [A3–A4]). The density of NPY+ interneurons in all subfields appeared greater in young rats (Fig. 1 [A2–A4] than in aged rats (Fig. 2 [A2–A4]), which is consistent with the previous reports [18], [38]. In comparison to the age-matched intact hippocampus, three hours of AS activity substantially reduced the density of NPY+ interneurons in different regions of the young hippocampus (Fig. 1 [B1–B4]), but not in the aged hippocampus (Fig. 2 [B1–B4]). However, both young and aged rats displayed an increased expression of NPY in the dentate mossy fibers within the hilus as well as in the principal mossy fiber bundle following three hours of AS activity (Figs. 1 and 2 [B1, B2, B4]), which is consistent with the purported role of the NPY in seizure modulation [32], [49].\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024493.g001Figure 1 Distribution of neuropeptide Y-positive (NPY+) interneurons in different subfields of the hippocampus in an intact young adult rat (A1) and a young adult rat that underwent three hours of acute seizure (AS) activity (B1).Figures A2–A4 show magnified views of the dentate gyrus, the CA1 subfield and the CA3 subfield from the figure A1. Figures B2–B4 show magnified views of the dentate gyrus, the CA1 subfield and the CA3 subfield from the figure B1.

With regard to the loss of NPY+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus, we found significant main effects of age (F\\u200a=\\u200a54.6, p<0.0001; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12) and AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a75.9, p<0.0001; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12). We also found a clear interaction between age and AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a24.4; p<0.001; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12). This was evidenced by a differential loss of NPY+ interneurons to AS activity between young adult rats (63% reduction, p<0.0001; Fig. 3 [A]) and aged rats (40% reduction, p<0.05; Fig. 3 [A]). However, as aging alone induced 57% reduction in NPY+ interneuron number (p<0.0001), the overall number of NPY+ neurons in the dentate gyrus of aged rats after AS activity was 30% less than the number in the dentate gyrus of young adult rats that underwent a similar AS activity (p<0.05; Fig. 3 [A]). The CA3 subfield also showed a similar trend pertaining to the loss of NPY+ interneurons. This was exemplified by significant main effects of age (F\\u200a=\\u200a54.4, p<0.0001; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12) and AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a12.3, p<0.01; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12) as well as an interaction between age and AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a6.8, p<0.05; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12; Fig. 3 [B]). The interaction was evidenced by a 36% reduction in the number of NPY+ interneurons in young adult rats (p<0.01; Fig. 3 [B]), and by no significant reduction in the number of NPY+ interneurons in aged rats (p>0.05; Fig. 3 [B]). However, as aging alone induced 58% reduction in NPY+ interneuron number (p<0.0001), the overall number of NPY+ interneurons in the CA3 subfield of aged rats after AS activity was 43% less than the number in the CA3 subfield of young adult rats after a similar AS activity (p<0.05; Fig. 3 [B].\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024493.g003Figure 3 Comparison of the numbers of neuropeptide Y-positive (NPY+) interneurons in different regions of the hippocampus between the young adult naïve control rats, young adult rats that underwent three hours of acute seizure (AS) activity, aged naïve control rats, and aged rats that underwent three hours of AS activity.Two-way ANOVA analyses suggested significant main effects of age and AS activity for the dentate gyrus, the CA3 subfield and the entire hippocampus. Additionally, the interaction between age and AS activity was significant in these regions. In the CA1 subfield, there was a significant effect of age but not AS activity; there was also no interaction between age and AS activity (see “Results” section for details). Bonferroni post-tests revealed that: (i) the NPY+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus, the CA3 subfield, and the entire hippocampus of aged rats are less vulnerable to AS activity in comparison to their counterparts in young adult rats (A, B); and (ii) the NPY+ interneurons in the CA1 subfield are resistant to AS activity in both aged and young adult animals (C). Additionally note that, the residual numbers of NPY+ interneurons in different hippocampal regions of aged rats after AS activity are significantly lower than numbers in comparable regions of young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity (A–D), which is a consequence of reductions in the numbers of NPY+ interneurons with aging alone (A–D). *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; ****, p<0.0001.\\n\\nIn contrast to the above two regions, the CA1 subfield showed significant effects of age (F\\u200a=\\u200a27.3, p<0.001; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12) but not AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a3.2, p>0.05; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12). Furthermore, there was no interaction between age and AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a0.9, p>0.05; Fig. 3 [C]) because AS activity induced no significant loss of NPY+ interneurons, neither in young adults (19% reduction, p>0.05; Fig. 3 [C]) nor in aged rats (11% reduction, p>0.05; Fig. 3 [C]). However, as aging alone induced 44% reduction (p<0.01) in the NPY+ interneuron number, the overall number of NPY+ neurons that persisted in the CA1 subfield of aged rats after AS activity was 38% less than the number in the CA1 subfield of young adult rats after a similar AS activity (p<0.05; Fig. 3 [C]). Comparison of the NPY+ interneuron numbers for the entire hippocampus between different groups revealed a trend that was comparable to what was seen for the dentate gyrus and the CA3 subfield (Fig. 3 [D]). There were significant main effects of age (F\\u200a=\\u200a105.5, p<0.0001; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12) and AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a41.9, p<0.0001; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12) as well as a clear interaction between age and AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a21.4; p<0.001; Fig. 3 [D]). The interaction was evidenced by a greater loss of NPY+ interneurons in the hippocampus of young adult rats (42% reduction, p<0.0001; Fig. 3 [D]) than aged rats (17% reduction, p>0.05; Fig. 3 [D]) after comparable AS activity. However, as aging alone induced 57% reduction (p<0.0001) in the numbers of NPY+ interneurons, the overall numbers of NPY+ neurons that were surviving in the hippocampus of aged rats after AS activity was 48% less than the numbers in the hippocampus of young adult rats after similar AS activity (p<0.01; Fig. 3 [D]).\\n\\nThus, the NPY+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus and the CA3 subfield of aged rats were less vulnerable to AS activity in comparison to their counterparts in young adult rats. On the other hand, the NPY+ interneurons in the CA1 subfield were resistant to AS activity in both aged and young adult animals. Despite the above resistance, the residual numbers of NPY+ interneurons in different hippocampal regions of aged rats after AS activity were 30–43% lower than numbers in comparable regions of young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity. This discrepancy is clearly a consequence of reductions in the numbers of NPY+ interneurons with aging alone.\\n\\n\\nSurvival of PV+ hippocampal interneurons following three-hours of AS activity\\n\\nImmunohistochemical staining of sections with a PV antibody clearly visualized the pattern of distribution of PV+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 subfields of both young and aged intact control rats (Figs 4 and 5 [A1]). In both age groups, the PV+ neurons were seen in the hilus and/or the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (Figs.4 and 5 [A2]), strata oriens and pyramidale of the CA1 subfield (Figs. 4 and 5 [A3]) and strata pyramidale and radiatum of the CA3 subfield (Figs. 4 and 5 [A4]). The density of PV+ interneurons in all subfields was greater in the young rats (Fig. 4 [A2–A4] than in aged rats (Fig. 5 [A2–A4]), which is consistent with our previous report [17]. In comparison to the age-matched intact hippocampi, three hours of AS activity markedly reduced the density of PV+ interneurons in different regions of both young and aged hippocampi (Figs. 4 and 5 [B1–B4]). However, the different hippocampal cell layers of both young and aged rats that underwent three hours of AS activity displayed a density of PV+ fibers (presumably axons; Figs. 4 and 5 [B2–B4]) that is either similar or greater than their counterparts in the age-matched intact rats (Figs. 4 and 5 [A2–A4). This may be due to a compensatory axonal sprouting of residual PV+ interneurons following the AS-induced loss of a greater proportion of PV+ interneurons in both age groups.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024493.g004Figure 4 Distribution of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in different subfields of the hippocampus of an intact young adult rat (A1) and a young adult rat that underwent three hours of acute seizure (AS) activity (B1).Figures A2–A4 show magnified views of the dentate gyrus, the CA1 subfield and the CA3 subfield from the figure A1.

In all hippocampal regions, we found significant main effects of age (F\\u200a=\\u200a13.1–33.6, p<0.01 to 0.0001; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12) and AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a58.8–74.4, p<00001; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12). However, there was no interaction between age and AS activity (F\\u200a=\\u200a0.1–0.6, p>0.05; DFn\\u200a=\\u200a1, DFd\\u200a=\\u200a12) for the loss of PV+ interneurons in any of the hippocampal regions because AS activity induced considerable reductions in the numbers of PV+ interneurons in both young adult and aged groups (Fig. 6). The reductions in young adult rats were 54% for the dentate gyrus (p<0.001; Fig. 6 [A]), 63% for the CA3 subfield (p<0.0001 Fig. 6 [B]), and 60% for the CA1 subfield (p<0.001) as well as for the entire hippocampus (p<0.0001; Fig. 6 [C]). The reductions in aged rats were 75% for the dentate gyrus (p<0.001; Fig. 6 [A]), 63% for the CA3 subfield (p<0.001; Fig. 6 [B), 85% for the CA1 subfield (p<0.0001; Fig. 6 [C]) and 82% for the entire hippocampus (p<0.0001; Fig. 6 [D]).\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024493.g006Figure 6 Comparison of the numbers of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in different regions of the hippocampus between the young adult naïve control rats, young adult rats that underwent three hours of acute seizure (AS) activity, aged naïve control rats, and aged rats that underwent three hours of AS activity.A two-way ANOVA analysis suggested significant main effects of age and AS activity in all hippocampal regions but interaction between age and AS activity was absent (see “Results” section for details). Bonferroni post-tests revealed that the overall susceptibility of PV+ interneurons in different regions of the hippocampus to AS activity is similar between young adult and aged rats (A–D). Additionally, because of significant reductions in the numbers of PV+ interneurons with aging alone in most regions (A, B, D), the numbers of residual PV+ interneurons after AS activity in different hippocampal regions of aged rats are much lower than their counterparts in young adult rats after similar AS activity (A–D). *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; ***, p<0.001; ****, p<0.0001.\\n\\nThus, the susceptibility of PV+ interneurons in different regions of the hippocampus to AS activity is similar between the young adult and aged rats. However, because of significant reductions in the numbers of PV+ interneurons with aging alone (which comprised 42% for the dentate gyrus [p<0.01], 39% for the CA3 subfield [p<0.01], 23% for the CA1 subfield [p<0.01], and 31% for the entire hippocampus [p<0.01]), numbers of residual PV+ interneurons after AS activity in different hippocampal regions of aged rats were much lower than their counterparts in young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity. Overall, numbers of residual PV+ interneurons were 70% lower for the dentate gyrus, the CA1 subfield and the whole hippocampus (p<0.05 −0.01; Fig. 6 [A, C, D]), and 68% lower for the CA3 subfield (p<0.05; Fig. 6 [B]).\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThis study provides novel evidence of disparity in the susceptibility of two different subpopulations of interneurons to AS activity between the young adult hippocampus and the aged hippocampus. This was evidenced by the following observations. In comparison to the age-matched intact hippocampus, the overall diminution in the number of NPY+ interneurons after three-hour AS activity was substantial in the young adult hippocampus (42% reduction) but insignificant in the aged hippocampus (17% reduction). Additional subfield-specific quantification uncovered that AS activity induced loss of NPY+ interneurons in young adult rats was significant for the dentate gyrus and the CA3 subfield. In aged rats, it was significant only for the dentate gyrus. On the other hand, the overall decline in the number of PV+ interneurons after the three hours of AS activity was highly significant in both young adult hippocampus (60% reduction) and the aged hippocampus (82% reduction). Subfield-specific analyses revealed that AS activity induced loss of PV+ interneurons was considerable for all three regions of the hippocampus in both young adult and aged rats. Thus, in the aged hippocampus, the NPY+ interneurons are largely resistant to AS activity whereas PV+ interneurons are particularly vulnerable to AS activity. Interestingly, despite the above discrepancy in vulnerability between the two interneuron populations, residual numbers of both NPY+ and PV+ interneurons in the hippocampus of aged rats that underwent AS activity were much lower (48% lower for NPY+ interneurons and 70% lower for PV+ interneurons) than their counterparts in the hippocampus of young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity. This is mainly because of significant reductions in the numbers of NPY+ and PV+ interneurons with aging alone.\\n\\n\\nPotential reasons for differential sensitivity of NPY+ and PV+ interneurons to AS activity in the aged hippocampus\\n\\nA reduced vulnerability of NPY+ interneurons in the aged hippocampus is not due to a reduced number of seizures in the aged rats during the period of AS activity. This is because, seizure analyses during the three-hours of AS activity performed in these rats and reported earlier revealed no differences between the two age groups for the numbers of stage III or stage V seizures but increased numbers of stage IV seizures in aged rats [28]. Moreover, the discrepancy is also not due to a reduced hippocampal principal neuron loss in aged rats after AS activity because aged rats exhibited similar neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation as the young adult rats after AS activity except for the hippocampal CA1 region where aged rats exhibited much greater level of neurodegeneration [28]. On the other hand, a greater sensitivity of the PV+ interneurons to AS activity observed in both age groups could be because the PV+ interneurons being the fast-spiking interneurons have greater susceptibility to AS activity [39]. Another possibility is that the residual PV+ interneurons in the aged hippocampus have a greater level of afferent synaptic connectivity with principal hippocampal neurons (such as dentate granule cells, and CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons) than NPY+ interneurons. Furthermore, aging may be associated with differential changes in the intrinsic properties of hippocampal interneurons expressing NPY and PV such as a reduced excitability in NPY+ interneurons and a greater excitability in PV+ interneurons following afferent stimulation due to differential changes in glutamate or other receptors that promote excitatory neurotransmission in these interneurons. Additionally, it may be that the firing of principal neurons in the aged hippocampus during AS activity is not strong enough to cause widespread degeneration of NPY+ interneuron numbers but adequate for inducing degeneration of fast-spiking PV+ interneurons. Indeed, a previous study showed that while both young and aged rats exhibited an increase in the EEG power during the AS activity, visual inspection and spectral analysis revealed a reduction of the faster frequencies in the EEGs of aged animals despite a shorter latency to stage V seizures in comparison to young rats [40]. It is conceivable that a reduced EEG activity in aged animals is sufficient for inducing degeneration of significant numbers of hippocampal principal neurons and PV+ interneurons but not NPY+ interneurons. Further studies are required to recognize the contribution of above possibilities to the relative resistance of NPY+ interneurons in the aged hippocampus to AS activity.\\n\\n\\nImplications of reduced numbers of NPY+ interneurons in the aged hippocampus after AS activity\\n\\nIn the hippocampus, the NPY+ inhibitory GABA-ergic interneurons are mainly distributed in the dentate hilus and the CA1 and CA3 strata oriens and pyramidale [12], [38], [41]. In the dentate gyrus, the axons of these interneurons synapse on the excitatory dentate granule cells. The NPY is essential for various functions in the hippocampus. First, the NPY+ interneurons in the hippocampus play vital roles in inhibiting the activity of hippocampal circuitry by consistently hyperpolarizing and reducing the spike frequency of excitatory neurons [33]. Previous studies also indicate that the NPY modulates the excitatory synaptic neurotransmission in the hippocampus by inhibiting the glutamate release on to principal hippocampal neurons [42], [43]. Second, the NPY is an anticonvulsant protein. This is supported by many previous observations, which comprise an increased hippocampal NPY expression in response to status epilepticus in young adult rats as a compensatory means to reduce seizures [32], [44], [45], seizure activity in response to reduced levels of NPY [45], and a reduced epileptiform-like activity with the administration of NPY in animal models of epilepsy [46]–[49]. Third, NPY has a role in the hippocampal neurogenesis and functions such as learning, memory and mood, as it enhances the proliferation of neural stem cells and augments the mitogenic effect of the fibroblast growth factor-2 on neural stem cells [31], [32], [50].\\n\\nFrom the above, it appears that considerably decreased number of NPY+ interneurons observed in both young adult and aged hippocampi after AS activity plays a role in the progression of AS activity into chronic epilepsy and cognitive dysfunction. However, as the overall number of residual NPY+ neurons in the aged hippocampus after AS activity is 48% fewer than the young adult hippocampus after similar AS activity, the implications of reduced NPY levels on hippocampal functions are likely much greater in aged animals. These may include significantly decreased inhibition of hippocampal excitatory neurons resulting in widespread epileptiform activity and spontaneous seizures, and vastly decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and severely impaired hippocampal-dependent learning and memory function. Indeed, our earlier report has shown that aged rats exhibit much greater propensity for developing TLE characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures after 3 hours of AS activity than young adult rats undergoing similar AS activity [28]. Furthermore, the overall intensity and severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures in the chronic phase after AS activity were much greater in aged rats than in young adult rats [28]. Additionally, aged rats that underwent 3 hours of AS activity were incapable of learning a spatial task in a water maze test whereas young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity exhibited capacity for spatial learning but had memory dysfunction [28].\\n\\n\\nImplications of substantially reduced PV+ interneuron numbers in the aged hippocampus after AS activity\\n\\nIn the hippocampus, PV+ inhibitory GABA-ergic interneurons are typically observed in the dentate granule cell layer (as basket cells), and the strata oriens and pyramidale of CA1–CA3 subfields [51], [52]. The calcium binding protein PV+ interneurons have crucial functions in the hippocampus. First, these fast-spiking interneurons are a prime source of perisomatic inhibition onto hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the CA1–CA3 regions [12]. Second, the activity of PV+ interneurons is essential for maintaining the working memory function of the hippocampus, as selective ablation of PV+ interneurons in the CA1 subfield induces spatial working memory impairments [53]. Third, the activity of PV+ interneurons is necessary for synchronizing the hippocampal pyramidal neurons during network oscillations [34]. Because hippocampal network oscillations coordinate the firing of large neuronal populations at different time scales and maintain conditions for adaptive operation of networks during data encoding, processing and storage, the PV+ interneurons have functional relevance for contributing to cognitive processes handled by the hippocampus [54]. Fourth, reductions in the PV+ interneuron subpopulation can be a key factor in the epileptogenic process, as PV deficiency affects network properties resulting in an increased susceptibility to seizures [35], [36]. Our results show that, three hours of AS activity results in a substantial loss of PV+ interneurons in all regions of the hippocampus in both young adult and aged rats. The findings in young adult rats are consistent with the earlier reports on epileptic hippocampal tissues from TLE patients and animal models of TLE [55]–[58]. Previous studies show that seizure-induced loss of PV+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus can considerably reduce the inhibition of granule cells [59]–[63]. Because of a substantial loss suffered during the process of aging and a relatively greater loss in response to AS activity, the aged rats that underwent AS activity exhibit 70% lower PV+ interneurons than the young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity. From this perspective, it is likely that extensively decreased PV+ interneuron numbers in the aged hippocampus after AS activity contribute significantly to impairments in the various hippocampal functions described earlier [28].\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThis study demonstrates that the vulnerability of NPY+ and PV+ interneurons to three hours of AS activity in the aged hippocampus is distinct. While the NPY+ interneurons in the aged hippocampus were relatively resistant, the PV+ interneurons were highly susceptible to AS activity. Nonetheless, the residual numbers of both NPY+ and PV+ interneurons in the hippocampus of aged rats that underwent AS activity were much lower, in comparison to their counterparts in the hippocampus of young adult rats that underwent similar AS activity. This is mainly because of significant reductions in the numbers of NPY+ and PV+ interneurons with aging alone. Overall, these results underscore that AS activity-induced TLE in old age is linked with far fewer hippocampal NPY+ and PV+ interneuron numbers than AS-induced TLE in the young adult age. This discrepancy likely underlies the much severe spontaneous seizures and cognitive dysfunction observed in the aged population after AS activity [28].\\n\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\nFour groups of Fischer 344 (F344) rats obtained from the National Institutes of Aging colony at Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study. The groups comprised intact young adult rats (4–5 months old; n\\u200a=\\u200a5), intact aged rats (22 months old, n\\u200a=\\u200a5), young adult rats receiving graded intraperitoneal injections of KA (n\\u200a=\\u200a6), and aged rats receiving graded intraperitoneal injections of KA (n\\u200a=\\u200a7). The animals were housed in an environmentally controlled room with a 12∶12-hr light-dark cycle and were given food and water ad libitum. All experiments were performed as per the animal protocol (VA protocol #1105-006), approved by the animal studies subcommittee of the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\\n\\n\\nInduction of AS activity and SE in young adult and aged rats\\n\\nA detailed methodology for the induction of AS activity and SE in young adult and aged rats is described in our recent report [28]. In brief, rats received graded intraperitoneal injections of kainic acid (KA; 3mg/kg) every hour until they developed SE. The KA injections were terminated when rats displayed either a state of continuous stage IV seizures characterized by bilateral forelimb clonus with signs of rearing, or a first stage V seizure typified by bilateral forelimb clonus with rearing and falling followed by continuous stages III-V seizures for over 10 minutes. While young adult rats required an average of four hourly injections of KA for eliciting SE, the induction of SE in aged rats required an average of two hourly injections of KA [28]. Both groups of rats were allowed to have multiple stages III-V seizures after the onset of SE. However, after three hours of AS activity, all motor seizures were terminated with a single injection of diazepam (5 mg/Kg body weight [bw]). Despite the differing doses of KA required for induction of SE and AS activity, the severity of AS activity in terms of stages III-V seizures during a three-hour period were largely comparable between the two age groups [28].\\n\\n\\nAnimal perfusions and tissue processing\\n\\nTwelve days after the three hours of AS activity, surviving rats from both groups (n\\u200a=\\u200a5/group) were fatally anesthetized with isoflurane. Following this, the rats were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The rats from control groups (intact young adult and intact aged groups) were also similarly perfused. The brains were dissected out, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 hours at 4°C and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution in phosphate buffer (PB). Thirty-micrometer thick cryostat sections were cut coronally through the entire septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus and collected serially in 24-well plates filled with PB. Every 20th section through the entire hippocampus was then selected in each of the animals and processed for NPY immunohistochemistry, which visualized the NPY+ interneurons in different subfields of the hippocampus. A second set of sections (every 20th) were processed for PV immunohistochemistry for visualization of PV+ interneurons in different regions of the hippocampus.\\n\\n\\nNPY immunohistochemistry\\n\\nA detailed methodology for NPY immunohistochemistry is described elsewhere [37], [38]. Briefly, the sections were treated with 0.1 M Tris buffer (TB) containing 1% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes, washed in TB, treated consecutively with TB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Tris A; 10 minutes) and TB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.005% bovine serum albumin (Tris B) for 10 minutes each. Following this, the sections were incubated in a blocking solution containing 10% normal goat serum in Tris B for 45 minutes. Sections were washed again in Tris A and Tris B and incubated in rabbit anti-NPY antibody (1∶1000, Peninsula laboratories, San Carlos, CA.) for 48 hours at 4°C, washed consecutively in Tris A and Tris B solutions, and incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1∶1000; Vector) for 45 minutes. Following this, sections were washed successively in Tris A and Tris D (0.5 M TB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.005% bovine serum albumin), and incubated in the avidin-biotin complex (ABC; Vector) solution diluted in Tris D (1∶1000) for 60 minutes. The tissue-bound peroxidase was then developed using vector gray (Vector) as a chromogen. The sections were mounted on gelatin coated slides, dehydrated, cleared, and cover slipped with DPX.\\n\\n\\nPV immunohistochemistry\\n\\nA detailed methodology for PV immunohistochemistry is described in our earlier report [17]. In brief, the sections were treated with PBS solution containing 20% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes and then rinsed thrice in PBS. The sections were next blocked with 10% normal horse serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X 100, and incubated overnight in a mouse anti-parvalbumin antibody solution (1∶2000 in PBS, Sigma). Following this, the sections were washed in PBS, treated with the biotinylated anti-mouse IgG solution (Vector) for 60 minutes, washed in PBS, and incubated with the ABC reagent (Vector) for 60 minutes. The peroxidase reaction was developed using the diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a chromogen (Vector). The sections were mounted on gelatin coated slides, dehydrated, cleared, and cover slipped with DPX.\\n\\n\\nMeasurement of NPY+ and PV+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus and CA1 & CA3 subfields\\n\\nThe numbers of NPY+ and PV+ interneurons were measured for the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus in every 20th section through the entire septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus, in each animal belonging to the four groups (n\\u200a=\\u200a5/group). An optical fractionator method using the StereoInvestigator system (Microbrightfield Inc) was employed for counting of NPY+ and PV+ interneurons. The StereoInvestigator system consisted of a color digital video camera (Optronics Inc) interfaced with a Nikon E600 microscope.\\n\\n\\nOptical fractionator counting method\\n\\nA detailed methodology is described in our recent report [28]. Cells that are positive for NPY/PV in each of the three selected regions were counted from 50–500 frames chosen via a systematic random sampling procedure in every 20th section using a 100X oil immersion lens. A counting frame measuring 40×40 µm was used for all three regions (the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 subfields). For counting of cells in each section, the contours of different regions (the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 subfields) were first delineated using the tracing function of the StereoInvestigator. Following this, the optical fractionator unit was activated and the number and location of counting frames and the counting depth for each section was determined by entering parameters such as the grid size, the thickness of the top guard zone (4 µm) and the optical dissector height (8 µm). A computer controlled motorized stage then allowed the section to be analyzed at each of the counting frame locations. All NPY+/PV+ interneurons that were present within the 8 µm section depths in each location were counted. The above procedure was repeated for all serial sections. An option in the Stereo Investigator program allowed the experimenter to remain unaware of the running cell count totals until all sections for an animal were completed. The StereoInvestigator program then calculated the total number of NPY+/PV+ interneurons per each region by utilizing the optical fractionator formula, N\\u200a=\\u200a1/ssf.1/asf.1/hsf.EQ-. The abbreviation ssf represents the section sampling fraction, which was 20 in this study, as every 20th section was sampled. asf symbolizes the area sampling fraction, which was calculated by dividing the area sampled with the total area of the respective subfield (i.e. the sum of subfield areas sampled in every 20th section). hsf stands for the height sampling fraction, which was calculated by dividing the height sampled (i.e. 8 µm in this study) with the section thickness at the time of analysis (i.e. 20 µm in intact control animals and 15 µm in animals that underwent 3 hours of AS activity). EQ- denotes the total count of particles sampled for the entire subfield.\\n\\n\\nData analyses\\n\\nThe values for NPY+ and PV+ interneurons were calculated separately for each region in every animal before calculating the means ± standard errors (S.E.M.) for the four groups. The NPY+/PV+ interneuron counts in different regions of intact young adult rats (n\\u200a=\\u200a5), young adult rats that underwent 3-hours of AS activity (n\\u200a=\\u200a5), intact aged rats (n\\u200a=\\u200a5), and aged rats that underwent 3-hours of AS activity (n\\u200a=\\u200a5) were compared to determine the main significant effects of age and AS activity and the potential interaction between age and AS activity on the extent of interneuron loss. For this, values from the above four groups were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests. The differences were considered significant if the p values were found to be less than 0.05. Specifically, we examined whether the effects of 3-hours of AS activity on the survival of NPY+ and PV+ interneurons in different regions of the hippocampus differ between the young adult and aged groups.', 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Differential Susceptibility of Interneurons Expressing Neuropeptide Y or Parvalbumin in the Aged Hippocampus to Acute Seizure Activity', 'journal_title': 'PLoS ONE'}\n",

They play a critical role in the intestinal mucosal immune response through transport of viruses, bacteria and other particles and antigens across the epithelium to immune cells within Peyer&#x02019;s patch regions and other mucosal sites. Recent studies in mice have demonstrated that M cells are generated from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs), and that infection with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium increases M cell formation. However, it is not known whether and how these findings apply to primary human small intestinal epithelium propagated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> setting.</p></sec><sec id=\"sec002\"><title>Methods</title><p>Human intestinal crypts were grown as monolayers with growth factors and treated with recombinant RANKL, and assessed for mRNA transcripts, immunofluorescence and uptake of microparticles and <italic>S</italic>.

RANKL stimulation of the monolayer cultures caused dramatic induction of the M cell-specific markers, <italic>SPIB</italic>, and Glycoprotein-2 (<italic>GP2</italic>) in a process primed by canonical WNT signaling. Confocal microscopy demonstrated a pseudopod phenotype of GP2-positive M cells that preferentially take up microparticles. Furthermore, infection of the M cell-enriched cultures with the M cell-tropic enteric pathogen, <italic>S</italic>.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain enteral uptake of viruses and microbes, including disruptions of the epithelial barrier, transcytosis across enterocytes, infection of juxtaposed dendritic cells and/or lymphocytes, and through microfold (M) cells located within the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) that overlies Peyer&#x02019;s patches [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref001\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>], or are scattered along the villus-independent of Peyer&#x02019;s patches [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref002\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. These cells represent a major site for the sampling of gut luminal antigens, and are important for enteral uptake of various commensal microorganisms, and viral and bacterial pathogens including <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, HIV, Reovirus, Poliovirus and others [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref001\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref004\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>].</p><p>M cells lack the typical tightly packed long microvilli characteristic of enterocytes, and instead have disorganized stubby microvilli along their apical border [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref002\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. In addition, M cells have deep basolateral invaginations that are often found to harbor immune cells. This morphology allows for efficient antigen and microbial sampling along with rapid transcytosis. Thus far, the assessment of how various pathogens are transmitted across the human intestinal epithelial layer has been limited to immortalized colon cancer cell lines [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref005\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref007\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>].</p><p>All epithelial cells of the gut are derived from dividing crypt-based intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that undergo long-term self-renewal to maintain the stem cell population and are uniquely identified by expression of <italic>Lgr5</italic> [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref008\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>]. The differentiated epithelial lineages of the small intestine include Paneth cells, goblet cells, tuft cells, enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, and M cells, all of which have specialized roles required for proper alimentation within the context of a complex symbiotic luminal microbiota. By nature, the ISCs are particularly sensitive to injury under stressful conditions including infection; however, a quiescent cell population of secretory progenitor cells (+4 cells) can de-differentiate into <italic>bona fide</italic> LGR5+ rapidly dividing ISCs [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref009\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>]. Under both homeostatic and stressed conditions, the function of ISCs and the quiescent +4 cell are believed to be influenced by various cells within the niche&#x02013;including subepithelial myofibroblasts, lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.</p><p>Epithelial lineage differentiation in the small intestine is controlled a complex cascade of lineage-specific transcription factors that are activated by the Notch signaling pathway in ISCs and early progenitor cells which dictates differentiation into absorptive or secretory cell lineages [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref010\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref012\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>]. Furthermore, lineage differentiation is influenced by the cellular microenvironment. For example, development of M cells located within the FAE is controlled in mice by a subepithelial network of reticular cells and B cells that secrete the cytokine, receptor activator of NF-&#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL)&#x02014;a type II member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref013\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>]. The binding of RANKL to its receptor, RANK (TNFRSF11a), activates the non-canonical (RelB) NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, and induces the expression of <italic>SpiB</italic>, an ETS-transcription factor that drives M cell fate determination and maturation [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref014\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref016\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that M cells can be generated using a murine <italic>in vitro</italic> enteroid model in a RANKL-dependent manner [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref017\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. Lineage-tracing studies demonstrated that M cells are derived from LGR5+ ISCs through RANKL induction of <italic>SpiB</italic>. RANKL stimulation of LGR5+ crypts from <italic>SpiB</italic> null mice failed to generate M cells, confirming that <italic>SpiB</italic> expression is required for M cell development [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref017\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. In addition, acute <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection in mice has been shown to induce rapid transdifferentiation of enterocytes into functional M cells through WNT/<bold>&#x003b2;</bold>-catenin and NF-&#x003ba;B dependent epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref016\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>]. This follows similar patterns of EMT observed in other cell types through the same WNT/<bold>&#x003b2;</bold>-catenin and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref018\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref020\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>].</p><p>Intestinal enteroids are an <italic>in vitro</italic> model that supports the proliferation and differentiation of ISCs into the full array of epithelial lineages that comprise the lining of the gut [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref008\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>].

Cells in this system retained the ability to differentiate into different epithelial lineages representative of crypt and villi, but they lacked M cell markers under typical culture conditions.

Specifically, SopB secreted by <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and other pathogens induce rapid transdifferentiation of enterocytes into M cells via EMT.

Typhimurium delivery was associated with an increases in M cell number in non-FAE crypts isolated from the proximal bowel [<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0148216.g005\">Fig 5E</xref>]. The ability of proximal bowel crypts to be responsive to RANKL would suggest the presence of its receptor, RANK, or other important components of the signaling pathway in epithelium that might be capable of differentiating to M cells. Further experiments with increasing time of Salmonella presence would further characterize the time course of M cell transition that occurs with SopB presence.</p><p>The putative WNT source within the gut is more prominent within the niche located in the crypt base, and one might anticipate that since FAE are flat dome-like structures without the typical villus structure, that WNT signaling may be potent throughout [<xref rid=\"pone.0148216.ref035\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>]. However, the requirement of WNT/RANKL signaling to generate M cells would suggest that along the villus length in non-dome structures, M cells may differentiate at the crypt base and whether it retains M cell feature once these signals diminish would need to be addressed. Nevertheless, the lymphoid follicles in the gut are enriched with B cell expressing RANKL and their abundance and proximity likely accounts for the enrichment of M cell within the FAE. Additional assessments should include whether M cells generated from non-FAE crypts have a mesenchymal phenotype, and whether EMT or MET are common fates outside of the FAE during homeostatic and disease states such as during chronic inflammation or infection such as in environmental enteropathy will require further assessments using similar <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\" id=\"sec013\"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id=\"sec014\"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All human tissues used in this study were obtained from de-identified and discarded surgical specimens following clinical surgical pathology evaluation.

\"\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe single layer of epithelial cells that lines the entire intestinal tract is the primary physical barrier separating the intestinal lumen and its content from the intestinal lamina propria and the body’s interior. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain enteral uptake of viruses and microbes, including disruptions of the epithelial barrier, transcytosis across enterocytes, infection of juxtaposed dendritic cells and/or lymphocytes, and through microfold (M) cells located within the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) that overlies Peyer’s patches [1], or are scattered along the villus-independent of Peyer’s patches [2]. These cells represent a major site for the sampling of gut luminal antigens, and are important for enteral uptake of various commensal microorganisms, and viral and bacterial pathogens including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Vibrio cholerae, HIV, Reovirus, Poliovirus and others [1–4].\\n\\nM cells lack the typical tightly packed long microvilli characteristic of enterocytes, and instead have disorganized stubby microvilli along their apical border [2]. In addition, M cells have deep basolateral invaginations that are often found to harbor immune cells. This morphology allows for efficient antigen and microbial sampling along with rapid transcytosis. Thus far, the assessment of how various pathogens are transmitted across the human intestinal epithelial layer has been limited to immortalized colon cancer cell lines [5–7].\\n\\nAll epithelial cells of the gut are derived from dividing crypt-based intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that undergo long-term self-renewal to maintain the stem cell population and are uniquely identified by expression of Lgr5 [8]. The differentiated epithelial lineages of the small intestine include Paneth cells, goblet cells, tuft cells, enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, and M cells, all of which have specialized roles required for proper alimentation within the context of a complex symbiotic luminal microbiota. By nature, the ISCs are particularly sensitive to injury under stressful conditions including infection; however, a quiescent cell population of secretory progenitor cells (+4 cells) can de-differentiate into bona fide LGR5+ rapidly dividing ISCs [9]. Under both homeostatic and stressed conditions, the function of ISCs and the quiescent +4 cell are believed to be influenced by various cells within the niche–including subepithelial myofibroblasts, lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.\\n\\nEpithelial lineage differentiation in the small intestine is controlled a complex cascade of lineage-specific transcription factors that are activated by the Notch signaling pathway in ISCs and early progenitor cells which dictates differentiation into absorptive or secretory cell lineages [10–12]. Furthermore, lineage differentiation is influenced by the cellular microenvironment. For example, development of M cells located within the FAE is controlled in mice by a subepithelial network of reticular cells and B cells that secrete the cytokine, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)—a type II member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily [13]. The binding of RANKL to its receptor, RANK (TNFRSF11a), activates the non-canonical (RelB) NF-κB signaling pathway, and induces the expression of SpiB, an ETS-transcription factor that drives M cell fate determination and maturation [14–16].\\n\\nRecent studies have demonstrated that M cells can be generated using a murine in vitro enteroid model in a RANKL-dependent manner [17]. Lineage-tracing studies demonstrated that M cells are derived from LGR5+ ISCs through RANKL induction of SpiB. RANKL stimulation of LGR5+ crypts from SpiB null mice failed to generate M cells, confirming that SpiB expression is required for M cell development [17]. In addition, acute S. Typhimurium infection in mice has been shown to induce rapid transdifferentiation of enterocytes into functional M cells through WNT/β-catenin and NF-κB dependent epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [16]. This follows similar patterns of EMT observed in other cell types through the same WNT/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways [18–20].\\n\\nIntestinal enteroids are an in vitro model that supports the proliferation and differentiation of ISCs into the full array of epithelial lineages that comprise the lining of the gut [8]. Several groups, including our own, have developed methods to grow human enteroids including in a 2D modular configuration using Transwells that separates luminal and subepithelial compartments [21,22]. Here we set out to adapt the enteroid model for the formation of M cells from proximal human small intestinal crypts, and characterize the cells in regard to their ability to endocytose microparticles and permit uptake of S. Typhimurium, both of which are characteristics of M cells in vivo.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nRANKL-Induces M Cell Differentiation in a Dose- and Time-Dependent Fashion\\n\\nPrimary human intestinal crypts isolated from discarded surgical samples of the proximal small intestine were grown on both 2D collagen-coated plates, and as 3D Matrigel plugs in ENRY medium that promotes their growth [22,23] with and without addition of recombinant RANKL every other day. RANKL stimulated a marked increase in SPIB expression at each concentration tested in 2D-grown monolayers when compared to proximal whole small bowel controls [Fig 1A]. Similarly, RANKL promoted expression of GP2, a cell surface marker specifically expressed on M cells and absent on other ISC-derived cells [24] in a concentration- and time-dependent manner [Fig 1A]. Increased expressed of SPIB and GP2 were first evident at day 4 and peaked at day 7 following RANKL exposure [Fig 1B, data not shown]. Similar results were obtained when enteroids were grown in 3D configuration (data not shown).\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148216.g001Fig 1 RANKL induces M cell differentiation in a dose and time dependent manner.(A) Dose-dependent increases of SPIB and GP2 mRNA expression in 50, 100 and 200 ng/mL RANKL and ENRY treated monolayers assessed at day 5. (B) Time course of SPIB and GP2 peaked expression levels in monolayers treated with and without 200ng/mL RANKL. (C) Time decay of SPIB and GP2 expression among monolayers receiving 0, 1, 2, or 3 doses of RANKL every other day from day 0, and assessed on days 7, 9, 11 and 13. All results normalized to GAPDH expression in human whole proximal small bowel or crypts, as indicated. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.\\n\\nNext we examined the timing of the RANKL effects on M cell formation. Two doses of RANKL on days 0 and 2 generated the highest expression of the M cell markers, SPIB and GP2, as assessed at varying times after RANKL exposure, whereas a single dose or three doses led to lower expression [Fig 1C]. In all dosing variations, a progressive decrease of both SPIB and GP2 expression was observed at longer times after the final RANKL exposure [Fig 1C]. Together, these data show that RANKL stimulates expression of M cell associated transcripts in human enteroids in a concentration- and time-dependent manner that is maximally effective when added for a limited time early in culture.\\n\\nThe induction of M cell-specific transcripts was paralleled by increased protein expression, as shown by immunofluorescence staining for GP2 [Fig 2A]. Of the cells identified by DAPI nuclear staining, 36.0 ± 12.9% were positive for GP2 in the RANKL-treated group, compared to only 0.2 ± 0.4% in the untreated controls (p<0.005). The majority of the M cells were observed near the periphery of cell islands within the monolayers. Control staining for EPCAM, a ubiquitous epithelial cell surface marker, confirmed that the epithelial nature of majority of cells in the monolayer [Fig 2A]. Closer examination of the RANKL treated monolayer cultures by confocal microscopy revealed that the GP2-positive M cells when grown in 2D exhibited pseudopod-like cell surface structures extending from the membrane [Fig 2B]. Furthermore, the cells lacked the uniformity of epithelial cells seen by EPCAM staining of non-RANKL treated cultures [Fig 2B].\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148216.g002Fig 2 RANKL induces M cell surface marker presence and typical morphology.(A) Epifluorescense imaging (100X magnification) of human intestinal monolayers showing uniform expression of epithelial cell surface marker EPCAM in no RANKL and RANKL-treated monolayers, confirming epithelial origin. This is in comparison to M cell surface marker GP2 absence in no RANKL group versus positive GP2 staining in RANKL monolayer groups. (B) Confocal microscopy assessment (400X magnification) of immunostained RANKL treated monolayers showing membrane surface and cytoplasmic GP2 staining, demonstrating the characteristic M cell morphology of pseudopod-like projections (white arrows). Scale bar 100 μm.\\n\\n\\nCanonical WNT Primes Stem Cells for RANKL-Induced M Cell Formation\\n\\n\\nIn vitro expansion of human enteroids is known to require canonical-WNT stimulation where R-spondin (RSPO) is indispensable, while WNT3a, and/or the GSK-3β inhibitor, CHIR99021 (GSKi) enhance robust growth [21,22,25]. RSPO, a potent inducer of the canonical-WNT pathway, significantly potentiated the time-dependent increase in SPIB and GP2 expression when used alone even in the absence of RANKL [Fig 1B] [26]. To further assess the consequences of canonical-WNT on M cell differentiation, two experiments were performed. The first examined the effect of GSKi with and without RANKL, while the second determined the effect of various doses of WNT3a prior to passaging the cells in the presence or absence of RANKL.\\n\\nGSKi that was added on day 0 in the absence of RANKL increased GP2 and SPIB transcripts by six-fold at an early time point (day 4) [Fig 3A]. By day 7, however, the ENRY only group (without GSKi) reached the same levels of GP2 and SPIB expression, which suggests the possible role of RSPO synergism at later time points [Fig 3A]. As shown above, however, RANKL administration was required to achieve >100-fold enhanced ability for monolayers to form M cells [Fig 3A].\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148216.g003Fig 3 Canonical-WNT signal primes ISCs for RANKL induced M cell differentiation(A) Time course of SPIB and GP2 peaked expression levels in monolayers treated with and without 200ng/mL RANKL. (B) Cells were treated with 0%, 5%, and 50% WNT3a-CM for 7 days, and on day 0 and 2 of the subsequent passage, cells were treated with ±200ng/mL RANKL and assessed 5 days later. All samples received ENRY complete medium and were assessed by quantitative PCR; all results normalized to GAPDH expression in human whole small bowel or crypts, as indicated. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.\\n\\nTo further examine the consequences of WNT3a signaling, monolayers were grown with ENRY and treated for 7 days with various doses of WNT3a prior to passaging the cells in either the presence or absence of RANKL; cultures were assessed 5 days later. Monolayers treated with RANKL and 5% WNT3a-conditioned media (WNT3a-CM) showed the greatest M cell formation, as SPIB and GP2 expression were 130- and 120-fold higher than controls, respectively [Fig 3B]. This is in comparison to the 0% WNT3a-CM group where SPIB and GP2 mRNA levels increased 70 and 100-fold, and 50% WNT3a-CM group to 95- and 20-fold over controls, respectively [Fig 3B]. Without RANKL administration, all groups showed lower levels of expression compared to control samples. Taken together, these data suggest that the process of M cell differentiation is augmented through the canonical WNT signaling pathway, but that RANKL is required to induce a more robust differentiation process.\\n\\n\\nCultured M Cells Demonstrate Functionality with Increased Microparticle Uptake\\n\\nM cells have a high capacity to endocytose and transcytose particulates [27]. Utilizing the same mechanisms that facilitate viral and bacterial transcytosis, M cells take up nanospheres as small as 20 nm, and microparticles as large as 10 μm [27]. The highest uptake rates are observed with particles of 1 μm diameter [28,29]. To explore the endocytic properties of in vitro derived human M cells, we incubated RANKL-treated monolayer cultures with fluorescent latex microparticles (1 μm) and performed confocal microscopy after 60–120 minutes. Microparticles were observed within GP2-positive cells using a Z-stack projection [Fig 4A]. By comparison, non-RANKL treated monolayers stained with the ubiquitous epithelial marker, E-cadherin, showed a lack of any microparticle uptake [Fig 4B]. Quantification by epifluorescence microscopy confirmed significantly greater (18-fold) microparticle uptake in RANKL-treated monolayer cultures compared to the non-RANKL treated group [Fig 4C].\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148216.g004Fig 4 RANKL treated monolayers demonstrate functional M cells through uptake of fluorescent 1μm Texas Red latex microparticles.(A) Confocal microscopy z-stack assessment (400X magnification) showing colocalization of fluorescent 1μm Texas Red latex microparticles and GP2 positive stained M cells with enlarged sections [x,y] showing clumping of microparticles.

Scale bar 50 μm. ****p<0.0001.\\n\\n\\nPreferential Uptake of S. Typhimurium into Cultured M Cells\\n\\nM cells function as a gateway for many bacterial and viral pathogens to initiate host infection. For example, S. Typhimurium exploits the phagocytic properties of M cells by preferentially adhering to and entering M cells in the intestinal mucosa [3,27]; however, this has never been shown with primary human cells To further explore the utility of our M cell model, we infected RANKL-treated and untreated monolayers with GFP-labeled S. Typhimurium for 1 h, washed the cultures, and incubated them for an additional hour with gentamicin to kill the remaining extracellular bacteria. Among RANKL untreated monolayers, there was very limited bacterial uptake in the 10^5 and 10^6 inocula, but a more generalized cellular uptake in the 10^7 inoculum [Fig 5A]. When compared to RANKL treated groups, bacteria were preferentially associated with GP2-positive M cells over a range of inocula [Fig 5B–5D]. Specifically, low (10^5 and 10^6) inocula non-M cells show a very low predilection for bacterial uptake, whereas, normalized to cell density, M cells were 50 and 65-fold more likely to contain S. Typhimurium [Fig 5B–5D]. In other words, virtually all S. Typhimurium bacteria were localized within M cells in these lower inocula. However, high inoculum (10^7) cultures show some bacterial co-localization both non-M cells and M cells. The key difference is that M cells in the high inoculum culture demonstrate a significantly higher density of bacterial sampling, containing many bacteria in each cell [Fig 5C]. Taken together, this data suggest that M cells preferentially endocystose S. Typhimurium bacteria, but at a critical concentration, invasion of non-M cells becomes possible.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148216.g005Fig 5 Cultured M cells preferentially uptake S.

Typhimurium associated with an increased number of M cells after only 60 minutes of bacterial presence; Scale bar 100μm;*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.\\n\\n\\nS. Typhimurium Induces M Cell Differentiation\\n\\nBacterial challenge, specifically with S. Typhimurium, in bovines was shown to induce rapid (<1 h) transdifferentiation of enterocytes to M cells in the presence of RANKL through the canonical-WNT pathway in a process mediated by the bacterial effector SopB [16]. While cultures infected with the lower inocula (10^5 and 10^6) had a similar proportion of M cells compared to uninfected control cultures, monolayers infected with the highest inoculum (10^7) showed a near doubling of the number of GP2+ cells within 1 h after infection [Fig 5E]. It shows for the first time that the transition is cell-autonomous without a requirement for other, non-epithelial cell types.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWe have developed a robust human in vitro model that is enriched for M cells grown from crypts of the proximal small intestine. The cultured M cells demonstrate several of the characteristic mRNA transcripts and cell surface markers of M cells in vivo, as well as the capability to internalize microparticles and bacteria such as S. Typhimurium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a tractable human M cell model system.\\n\\nWe have previously shown that human intestinal enteroids can be grown from discarded surgical samples and propagated indefinitely by weekly passage [21,22,25]. Cells in this system retained the ability to differentiate into different epithelial lineages representative of crypt and villi, but they lacked M cell markers under typical culture conditions. This current study expands upon our previous work by demonstrating that functional M cells can be generated in culture in a robust manner that recapitulates human M cells formation and function in vivo.\\n\\nMost M cell studies have focused on FAE, which overlies Peyer’s patches and is part of a continuous epithelial layer of the small intestine. In murine studies, M cell fate is dependent on RANKL stimulation, which induces the expression of SpiB through the WNT/β-catenin pathway [13,14,16]. Bacterial mediated mechanisms have also been shown to exploit the WNT/β-catenin pathway to induce rapid de novo M cell formation through a process of epithelial mesenchymal transition [16]. This study confirms prior knowledge that activation of the canonical-WNT pathway primes M cell differentiation; however, ultimate M cell differentiation is entirely dependent on RANKL through the NF-κB pathway [16]. Specifically, our data suggest significant induction of SPIB transcription activity even without RANKL stimulation in control groups receiving either RSPO alone or in combination with GSKi [Figs 1 and 3A]. However, exogenous RANKL is required to achieve optimal levels of SPIB activity to drive M cell generation. As expected, low dose WNT3a showed higher M cell marker expression compared to higher doses, likely because overstimulation with canonical WNT attenuates the more fully differentiated state [Fig 3B].\\n\\nConsistent with work done in mice, our data shows that the SPIB expression peaks after 2 days of RANKL administration, with GP2 levels peaking at day 4, and persisting through day 7 [Fig 3A, data not shown] [17]. We show that optimal RANKL delivery was at a concentration of 200 ng/mL administered at day 0 and day 2 only, while repeat dosing failed to further enhance M cell generation [Fig 1C].\\n\\nIn our monolayer cultures, we found evidence of deep pockets within M cells combined with pseudopod extensions [Fig 2B]. Additionally, we noticed a trail of GP2 staining adjacent to many of the M cells, and since GP2 selectively binds to the FimH component of the type I pili of S. Typhimurium and other pathogens, we expected to find bacteria adjacent to and within M cells [2]. This could possibly suggest GP2 shedding during the course of M cell movement toward the periphery, which may be related to typical movement along the FAE.\\n\\nA crucial feature of M cells is their role as antigen sampling and transcytotic sites. Microparticles have been targeted to M cells in in vivo animal studies for vaccine, adjuvant therapy and drug delivery [27]. Multiple reports have characterized size parameters for uptake into M cells, showing they are capable of taking up particles from 50 nm to 10 μm, although particles in the 0.5–2 μm range are transcytosed most effectively [28,29]. We observed clumping of microparticles within M cells—suggesting that multiple particles may reside in the same phagosome. The ability to create M cells from human intestinal crypts that have functional uptake of microparticles may improve high-throughput methods for optimization of vaccine and drug delivery [27,30].\\n\\nMany invasive bacteria cross the mucosal barrier often by exploiting the transcytotic ability of M cells and occasionally can be spread hematogenously [31–34]. S. Typhimurium not only invades M cells, but also through secretion of a type III effector protein named SopB, induces rapid differentiation of FAE enterocytes into M cells [16]. Interestingly, this occurs through inhibition of GSK3β, or the same β-catenin mediated mechanism as described above that we utilized to prime ISCs for M cell development [Fig 3A]. SopB was found to induce both the RANKL and the receptor RANK via WNT signaling, and was able to cause enterocyte transition within 60–180 minutes [16]. Specifically, SopB secreted by S. Typhimurium and other pathogens induce rapid transdifferentiation of enterocytes into M cells via EMT. However, in the bovine model, SopB-induced transition to M cells was limited to FAE crypts and was not observed in ordinary crypts [16]. In contrast, we found that increases in the density of S. Typhimurium delivery was associated with an increases in M cell number in non-FAE crypts isolated from the proximal bowel [Fig 5E]. The ability of proximal bowel crypts to be responsive to RANKL would suggest the presence of its receptor, RANK, or other important components of the signaling pathway in epithelium that might be capable of differentiating to M cells. Further experiments with increasing time of Salmonella presence would further characterize the time course of M cell transition that occurs with SopB presence.\\n\\nThe putative WNT source within the gut is more prominent within the niche located in the crypt base, and one might anticipate that since FAE are flat dome-like structures without the typical villus structure, that WNT signaling may be potent throughout [35]. However, the requirement of WNT/RANKL signaling to generate M cells would suggest that along the villus length in non-dome structures, M cells may differentiate at the crypt base and whether it retains M cell feature once these signals diminish would need to be addressed. Nevertheless, the lymphoid follicles in the gut are enriched with B cell expressing RANKL and their abundance and proximity likely accounts for the enrichment of M cell within the FAE. Additional assessments should include whether M cells generated from non-FAE crypts have a mesenchymal phenotype, and whether EMT or MET are common fates outside of the FAE during homeostatic and disease states such as during chronic inflammation or infection such as in environmental enteropathy will require further assessments using similar in vitro model systems.\\n\\n\\nMaterial and Methods\\n\\n\\nEthics Statement\\n\\nAll human tissues used in this study were obtained from de-identified and discarded surgical specimens following clinical surgical pathology evaluation. This was approved by the University of California Los Angeles Institutional Review Board approved procurement and use of surgical samples, which waived the requirement for informed consent for tissues obtained from the UCLA Translational Pathology Core Laboratory (IRB #11–002504).\\n\\n\\nIntestinal Crypt Isolation\\n\\nSmall intestinal crypts were isolated as previously described [21,23]. Briefly, crypts were resuspended in basic medium (Advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (ADMEM)/Ham's F12 (Invitrogen) with 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen). Crypt yield was determined by microscopic counting.\\n\\n\\nCell Culture\\n\\nA thin film of liquid type I collagen (Advanced BioMatrix, San Diego, CA) was plated onto the bottom surface of 48-well Nucleon Delta-treated cell culture plate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at a concentration of 100 ng/mL, incubated for 30 minutes, and then removed by aspiration. Human crypts were plated at a density of 500 crypts per well. These were grown as monolayers in Basic Medium with antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen), 1 mM N-Acetylcysteine (Sigma), 100 ng/ml recombinant murine Noggin (PeproTech), 50 ng/ml recombinant murine EGF (PeproTech), 1xN2 supplement (Invitrogen), 1xB27 supplement (Invitrogen), 1 μg/ml recombinant human R-spondin 1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 10 μM Y-27632 inhibitor (Stemgent), 1 mM recombinant human Jagged-1 (R&D Systems), 5 μM CHIR99021 (GSK-3β inhibitor) (Stemolecule). Alternatively, crypts were suspended within Matrigel at a concentration of 100 crypts per 25 μl of Matrigel and plated in 3D on the 48-well Nucleon Delta-treated cell culture plate.\\n\\n\\nRANKL Stimulation\\n\\nCells were divided into groups and recombinant human RANKL (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) added at different concentrations (50–200 ng/mL). Controls were left without RANKL. Fresh culture medium, growth factors and RANKL were given at day 0 and replaced every 2 days until cultures were fixed for histologic or RNA analysis. Growth of two-dimensional monolayers and three-dimensional structures were assessed using inverted light microscopy.\\n\\n\\nSubculturing of Human Monolayers\\n\\nTo examine the effect of WNT3a priming, a subset of monolayer cultures were treated with 0%, 5%, and 50% L-WNT3a conditioned medium (WNT3a CM), which was prepared as previously described, for 7 days [36]. After seven days of WNT3a-CM treatment, monolayers were digested using TrypLE (Life Technologies) at 37°C for three minutes. TrypLE was then quenched using 10% FBS in ADMEM/F12 and structures were mechanical split into small clusters of cells. In a 1:2 or 1:3 split, cell cluster were re-plated onto collagen-coated plates and split into 0%, 5% and 50% WNT3a-CM groups with and without 200 ng/mL RANKL.\\n\\n\\nMicroparticle Uptake\\n\\nAfter 4 days of culture, 1x105 1 μm fluorescent-Texas Red polystyrene microparticles (Thermo Scientific) were added to monolayers and incubated for 60–120 minutes (Figs A-C in S1 File). Each well was then washed with PBS three times to remove non-adherent microparticles, and cultures were fixed with 3.4% formalin. Epifluorescence imaging was used to quantify microparticle uptake in three randomly chosen high power fields in RANKL treated and non-treated groups.\\n\\n\\nImmunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy\\n\\nMonolayers cultured with and without latex microparticles were stained for Glycoprotein-2 (GP2) (MBL), E-cadherin (CDH1) (Dako), and Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) (Abcam). Epifluorescence microscopy was used to characterize differences between RANKL treated and non-treated groups. Confocal microscopy was used to characterize morphologic characteristics, as well as confirm z-stack co-localization of Texas Red latex microparticles within cells.\\n\\n\\nS. Typhimurium Inoculation\\n\\nAfter 4–9 days of culture, RANKL treated and untreated monolayers were inoculated with different inocula of GFP-labelled S. Typhimurium [37]. Antibiotics were removed by repeated washing before infections. Monolayers were then inoculated with 10^5, 10^6 and 10^7 CFU of GFP-labeled bacteria. After 1 h, plates were incubated with gentamicin for 15–60 mins, and washed three times with PBS. Monolayers were then fixed with 3.4% formalin for 5 mins.\\n\\nMonolayers were stained for GP2 and DAPI, and epifluorescence imaging was used to quantify GFP-labeled Salmonella inside GP2-positive cells as well as in non-GP2 stained cells in three randomly chosen high power fields.\\n\\n\\nRNA Analysis\\n\\nAt various time points, monolayer and three-dimensional cultures were harvested, and messenger RNA (mRNA) was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies) method. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to characterize expression of GP2, SPIB, Chromogranin A (CHGA), and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH). RT-PCR reactions were performed on a Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Cycle numbers were analyzed according to the comparative CT method using GAPDH as the internal calibrator and human intestinal crypts as the reference tissue [23].\\n\\n\\nStatistical Analysis\\n\\nTwo-tailed unpaired student's t-test was used to compare results, and associated p-values are reported.\\n\\n\\nSupporting InformationS1 File\\n\\n\\nTexas red microparticles and Human ISC monolayers.\\n\\n\\n(Fig A) Epifluorescense + light microscopy (25X) of a 2μL droplet of 1μm Texas red microparticles, and epifluorescense imaging (100X) of microparticles only pre- and post-washing demonstrating that microparticles can be washed away.

available Zn. In this study we compared organic and conventional wheat cropping systems with respect to DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid)-extractable Zn as a proxy for plant available Zn, yield, and grain Zn concentration. We analyzed soil and wheat grain samples from 30 organic and 30 conventional farms in Madhya Pradesh (central India), and conducted farmer interviews to elucidate sociological and management variables. Total and DTPA-extractable soil Zn concentrations and grain yield (3400 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) did not differ between the two farming systems, but with 32 and 28 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> respectively, grain Zn concentrations were higher on organic than conventional farms (<italic>t</italic> = -2.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Furthermore, multiple linear regression analyses revealed that (a) total soil zinc and sulfur concentrations were the best predictors of DTPA-extractable soil Zn, (b) Olsen phosphate taken as a proxy for available soil phosphorus, exchangeable soil potassium, harvest date, training of farmers in nutrient management, and soil silt content were the best predictors of yield, and (c) yield, Olsen phosphate, grain nitrogen, farmyard manure availability, and the type of cropping system were the best predictors of grain Zn concentration. Results suggested that organic wheat contained more Zn despite same yield level due to higher nutrient efficiency. Higher nutrient efficiency was also seen in organic wheat for P, N and S. The study thus suggests that appropriate farm management can lead to competitive yield and improved Zn concentration in wheat grains on organic farms.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id=\"award001\"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"funder-id\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002331</institution-id><institution>Stiftung Mercator Schweiz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frossard</surname><given-names>Emmanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The project was funded by WFSC Mercator Research Program (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.worldfoodsystem.ethz.ch/research.html\">http://www.worldfoodsystem.ethz.ch/research.html</ext-link>) and was conducted in the framework of long-term farming systems comparison in the tropics (SysCom) program, which is financially supported by Biovision Foundation for Ecological Development, Coop Sustainability Fund, Liechtenstein Development Service (LED) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).

It can be seen e.g. in the prevalence of stunted growth in children, which is estimated to affect 61 million children in India under 5 years of age [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref001\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>]. At the same time, low Zn availability in soils may limit crop yield [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref004\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. In India Zn deficiency is particularly prevalent in Alfisols, Vertisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols, and leached Ultisols [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref005\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>]. Under low Zn conditions, plant growth is severely reduced and other plant functions are disrupted, as may be expressed in increased susceptibility to diseases [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref006\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>]. Furthermore, with an annual production of almost 10<sup>11</sup> kg India is the second biggest producer of wheat globally, with most wheat being produced by the northern and central states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref007\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. In these states wheat is also the main staple crop [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref003\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>]. Research on increasing soil availability and grain Zn concentration in wheat is thus of great importance in India, as it 1) has the potential to alleviate health problems in humans associated with Zn deficiency and 2) may increase agricultural yields.</p><p>There are two main approaches for increasing grain Zn concentration: biofortification through crop breeding and agronomic biofortification through Zn fertilizer application [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref008\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>]. Breeding efforts, led by HarvestPlus and the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT), set the goal to increase grain Zn concentration in wheat from 25 to 37 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref009\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>]. Several studies have shown that Zn fertilization, especially foliar application, is an effective way to increase grain Zn concentration [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref002\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref010\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. Ram et al. (2015) reported over 100% increases in wheat grain Zn concentration from 25&#x02013;33 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 63&#x02013;70 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, coupled with significant yield increases, following soil and foliar application of Zn fertilizers on field trials in Punjab [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref002\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. Since grain Zn accumulation is related to soil Zn availability, enhancing soil Zn availability can also increase Zn concentration in cereal grains [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref008\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>]. A third approach for increasing cereal grain Zn concentrations&#x02013;that has received much less attention&#x02013;is biofortification through organic matter management [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref011\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>].</p><p>Together with pH, clay content, and concentrations of other nutrients (especially N and P), organic matter is one of the most important factors determining Zn availability in soils [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref012\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref013\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>]. Zn availability may decrease with increasing soil organic matter content, as organic matter binds Zn [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref014\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. However, other studies observed a positive correlation between DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid)-extractable Zn and organic matter across different soils, as organic matter may also be a source of exchangeable Zn [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref005\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>]. Thus it is conceivable that organic matter management may present a possibility for biofortification. While farmyard manure is a major source of Zn in agricultural systems [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref015\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>], addition of green manure (fresh plant residues) in pot studies was also shown to significantly improve the plant-available fraction of Zn in the soil and increase wheat grain concentrations from 20 to 31 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref011\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>].</p><p>Do organically grown cereals contain higher concentrations of Zn? Since organic agriculture relies on substantial inputs of organic matter in the form of farmyard manure, compost, or leguminous cover crops, it could potentially increase Zn concentration in the grains. While several studies have looked at yield [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref016\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>] or economic performance [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref017\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>] of organic farms, few studies have compared organic and conventional farming in terms of Zn biofortification. Organic farming has been shown to incur higher organic matter contents and increased soil biological activity [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref018\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref019\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]; however, crop yields are generally lower [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref016\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>]. Zn concentration in organically grown wheat on low-P soils in Australia was found to be higher, likely associated to increased mycorrhizal colonization, but the yields on organic farms were 17&#x02013;84% lower [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref020\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]. It is well known that yield correlates negatively with grain Zn concentration [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref021\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>]. Therefore it could be argued that dilution due to higher yield explains the relatively lower Zn concentration seen in conventional Australian farms. Accordingly, a study in Switzerland found no significant differences in grain Zn concentration in organically and conventionally grown wheat at a smaller yield difference of only 14% [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref022\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study we compared organic and conventional wheat cropping systems in terms of grain Zn concentration in a region with low soil Zn availability and where Zn malnutrition is a relevant human health problem. While in a first step soil extractable Zn concentration, wheat yield, and grain Zn concentration are compared between the two systems, in a second step the variability is explored through multiple linear regressions. We thus present possible drivers of extractable Zn concentration, wheat yield, and wheat grain Zn concentration. Our hypotheses were that organic cropping systems had: 1) higher extractable soil Zn concentrations, 2) lower yields, and 3) higher grain Zn concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\" id=\"sec002\"><title>Methods</title><sec id=\"sec003\"><title>Site description</title><p>The Nimar District of Madhya Pradesh, India (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g001\">Fig 1</xref>) was chosen for this study due to a well-established network of organic farmers, and the importance of wheat production in the area. According to UNICEF and the World Health Organization, Madhya Pradesh has childhood stunting levels of 50% and the highest prevalence of wasting (children under 5 whose weight is more than 2 standard deviations below the global median) in India [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref023\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref024\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>].

Compliance with internationally accepted certification standards and frequent visits by bioRe staff ensure that organic practices are appropriately followed on the registered organic farms. In 2007 a long-term field experiment was established at bioRe&#x02019;s research station, which compares conventional and organic cropping systems [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref026\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>].

Grains were sampled at the time of harvest in March-April 2015. Since not all of the farms could be reached at the same time, some farmers already harvested wheat prior to the second visit. In that case, the farmers set aside 100 g of grain sample. If the crop was still standing but ready to be harvested, 5&#x02013;7 ears were collected from each of the same 10 locations where soils had been sampled.

Multiple linear regression models were fitted to the three response variables \"extractable Zn in soil\", \"wheat yield\", and \"wheat grain Zn concentration\" by a stepwise procedure. For each response, we derived from our hypotheses a \"maximum-scope\" model that included all continuous explanatory variables that we expected to influence the response, along with their interactions with the categorical explanatory variables \"training,\" \"cropping system,\" and &#x0201c;cultivar&#x0201d; (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t001\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 1</xref>).

This may be due to the fact that there was little difference in the use of organic fertilizers between the two types of farms in our survey. Based on the farmyard manure indicator (FYM), availability of FYM on conventional farms was comparable to organic farms. The hypothesis that organic cropping systems would obtain lower yields was also not supported: both systems attained average yields around 3400 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. The nearby farming systems comparison field experiment reported yield levels of 2800&#x02013;3300 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for organic treatments and 3200&#x02013;4200 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for conventional treatments between 2007&#x02013;2010 [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref026\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>]. Probably due to smaller management differences on farms compared to those on the field trial, we did not find this yield gap on farms in the area. Eyhorn et al. [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref025\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>] also found higher or equal cotton yields of organic compared to conventional farmers in the area, despite lower organic cotton yields on the system-trial [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref026\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>].</p><p>Despite the similarities in soil conditions, farming practices, and yield level, organic wheat grains contained significantly higher concentrations of Zn. Since Zn is associated with N and S in proteins in grains [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref039\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref040\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>], the fact that these elements were also more enriched in organic grains was consistent with the finding of higher grain Zn. The HarvestPlus target is to increase wheat grain Zn in India from a baseline of 25 to 37 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, while maintaining a &#x0201c;competitive yield&#x0201d; [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref009\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>]. A multilocational irrigated trial with elite Zn lines in Northern India reported slightly higher average grain Zn concentrations (33.6 &#x000b1; 0.7 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) but at lower average yield levels (2700 &#x000b1; 200 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref041\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>] than in our survey here. Organic farmers in our study thus attained statistically significant and nutritionally relevant increases in grain Zn concentration. In the following we discuss how organic farmers could have achieved this increase in grain Zn concentration without compromising yield. The discussion addresses possible underlying mechanisms for the results of our regression analysis, as summarized in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g003\">Fig 3</xref>.</p><fig id=\"pone.0160729.g003\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of correlations as determined by multiple linear regressions in the case study area.</title><p>Solid lines refer to positive, dotted to negative effects. While soil available P had a positive effect on yield, it was negatively correlated to grain Zn concentration. Yield also has a negative relationship with grain Zn concentration. Organic farmers had improved grain Zn concentrations because they tended to have lower levels of available P in the soil but higher grain protein concentrations. Organic farmers were able to maintain yield levels of conventional farmers by compensating for the lack of chemical fertilizers (lower available soil P levels) with improved nutrient management training.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"pone.0160729.g003\"/></fig><sec id=\"sec016\"><title>What influenced extractability of Zn in soils?</title><p>Both total soil Zn and total soil S showed positive correlations with extractable soil Zn (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g004\">Fig 4</xref>). The larger the pool of total Zn, the more is also in DTPA-extractable forms. The positive relationship with S is less self-evident. In aerobic soils, the vast majority of S is in organic forms [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref042\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref>], and these S containing organic molecules may also bind Zn [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref043\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref>]. Thus the observed correlation between total soil S and DTPA-extractable Zn suggests that S containing organic molecules are important sources of available Zn in these soils. Neither pH (<italic>F</italic> = 0.50, <italic>p</italic> = 0.48) nor soil N (<italic>F</italic> = 1.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.22) had a significant correlation with extractable Zn, despite a known pH-dependence of Zn availability [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref013\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>]. The reason why we saw no pH-effect is probably that all soils were in neutral-slightly alkaline pH range and the dataset had a narrow range of pH values. The first and third quartiles of the pH distribution were 7.01 and 7.32 respectively. Accordingly, pH was also not a significant predictor of wheat yield or grain Zn concentration (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t003\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 3</xref>). Also, neither soil organic C nor the FYM indicator were a significant predictor of extractable Zn.</p><fig id=\"pone.0160729.g004\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><p><bold>Simple regressions of log(DTPA-extractable Zn) with a) total soil Zn and b) log(total soil S).</bold> P-values for the regressions were &#x0003c; 0.001 (<italic>F</italic> = 14.8) and 0.003 (<italic>F</italic> = 9.39), respectively.

Our results suggest that P was the main yield-limiting nutrient. In agreement with agronomic guidelines for fertilization (also based on Olsen P measurement), the slope of the yield trend line decreased as available P approached 15 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref044\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>]. However, yields of farmers who received training in nutrient management were less sensitive to low P levels (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g005\">Fig 5A</xref>). While our interview questionnaire did not address dissemination of other knowledge, it is likely that &#x0201c;training in nutrient management&#x0201d; also comes with other knowledge exchange, and general improved agronomic practices. Most organic farmers are/have been associated with bioRe, where they receive training and knowledge from time to time, along with appropriate seed and inputs for organic farming. Some of the organic farmers are also involved in the participatory research activities carried out by the innovation platform developed at bioRe in collaboration with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture, Switzerland [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref045\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. This suggests that organic farmers achieve similar yields to conventional farmers, despite not using chemical fertilizers, because good agricultural practice makes more out of available natural capital. The training effect also results in more homogeneous practices among organic farmers, as can be seen in the lower between-farm variability of yield for organic compared to conventional farmers (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g002\">Fig 2C</xref>).</p><fig id=\"pone.0160729.g005\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><p><bold>Regressions of wheat grain yield with a) available P, b) harvest date, and c) exchangeable K.</bold> Available P had a significant interaction effect with training on grain yield.

The further the wheat-growing season extended into the hot and dry Zaid season, the more likely the plants suffered from drought. The relationship between yield and exchangeable K (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g005\">Fig 5C</xref>) is less easy to interpret. A positive effect on predicted yield for NH<sub>4</sub>OAc-extractable K values below 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> was expected, since 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> is considered as the threshold below which an application of K fertilizer will increase yields [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref046\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]. Though values between 250&#x02013;800 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> are considered high, we have no reason to suspect phytotoxic effects at these levels. The low-yield points pulling the regression down for low K values are most likely due to other farm characteristics rather than a direct exchangeable K effect.</p></sec><sec id=\"sec018\"><title>What influenced grain Zn concentration?</title><p>Decreasing grain Zn concentrations associated with increasing grain yields are often interpreted as the result of a dilution effect due to a larger proportion of tissue with low Zn density [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref021\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>]. Vice versa, an increase in grain Zn concentration may just be a result of a decrease in yield. For example, a study in southeastern Australia showed that organic wheat cropping may increase grain Zn by 25&#x02013;56%, but at the expense of a 17&#x02013;84% decrease in yield [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref020\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]. Also in our study yield showed a strong negative correlation with grain Zn concentration, but there was no yield difference between organic and conventional wheat (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g006\">Fig 6A</xref>). Thus, the dilution effect does not explain the difference in grain Zn between the two cropping systems. Aside from yield, available soil P also correlated negatively with grain Zn (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g006\">Fig 6B</xref>), even if the yield effect was considered (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t003\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 3</xref>). A negative correlation of grain Zn with available P was also observed in wheat across three provinces in Iran [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref038\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In the latter study, Olsen P values were much higher than in our study, ranging from 10 to 165 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. One reason for P-induced Zn deficiency can be that mycorrhizal colonization is reduced with increasing soil P levels [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref047\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref>]. Mycorrhizae can make an important contribution to plant Zn nutrition on soils with low Zn solubility [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref048\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref>]. Higher abundance of mycorrhizal root colonization in organic than conventional farming explained higher grain Zn concentration in field trials in southeastern Australia [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref020\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]. The conventional farms in the latter study applied 16&#x02013;18 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup>, which is similar to the rates of P application of conventional farmers in our study (data not shown). However, since soils in our study were low in P (Olsen P values at 1&#x02013;14 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and we do not know of any studies showing P-inhibition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi at this level, we cannot explain the underlying mechanism behind the observed grain Zn&#x02013;soil available P relationship.</p><fig id=\"pone.0160729.g006\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><p><bold>Regressions of wheat grain Zn concentration with a) grain yield, b) available P, and c) grain protein concentration.</bold> Grain protein concentration had a significant interaction with cropping system on grain Zn concentration; orange shading refers to conventional.

Proteins act as a sink for Zn in grains [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref040\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. While the model with only soil and plant predictors showed a positive correlation between grain Zn and protein, by including management variables the positive correlation was only observed for organic farms (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t003\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 3</xref>)(<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g006\">Fig 6C</xref>). While conventional systems are usually less N-limited, we did not detect any differences in total soil N (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t002\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 2</xref>). Despite similar amounts of soil N, N uptake by wheat grains tended to be greater on organically managed fields (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t002\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 2</xref>). Similar to what was seen for P, this signifies a higher nutrient efficiency for organic wheat. Nutrient efficiency, not to be confused with nutrient use efficiency, is defined by differences in relative growth or yield under nutrient-limiting conditions [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref049\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref>]. While usually nutrient efficiency is used to compare different cultivars, we did not find any significant cultivar effects. Instead, sociological (training) and management (cropping system) variables affected yield response curve to P and grain Zn accumulation, respectively (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t003\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 3</xref>). Higher nutrient efficiency was also seen for S, where organic farms had significantly more grain S despite tending to have lower soil S concentration (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t002\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 2</xref>). A possible underlying mechanism could be soil biology, as it is generally accepted that organically managed soils support more active soil biology [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref018\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref019\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], and that N cycling in soils is largely driven by biotic factors [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref050\" ref-type=\"bibr\">50</xref>]. Since N does not seem to be limiting yield (no correlation between soil N and yield), additional N lead to a relative increase in protein concentration. Higher Zn concentration is thus a byproduct of higher protein content in grains.</p></sec><sec id=\"sec019\"><title>Implications</title><p>In this study we integrated soil and plant measurements with management and sociological variables to model DTPA-extractable Zn, yield, and grain Zn concentration. As can be seen in (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t003\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 3</xref>), inclusion of management variables improved the yield and grain Zn prediction models. None of the soil or plant variables were able to explain why organic farmers would achieve the same yield level as conventional despite lower available P levels. The training factor suggested that there was a human capital effect on organic farmer&#x02019;s yield. The harvest date variable also improved prediction of yield, as it served as a proxy for not easily-measurable field data. Unfortunately, we did not have the possibility to quantify soil moisture variables, e.g. by means of tensiometers, despite knowing that water stress would significantly influence yield in these irrigated agricultural systems. Harvest date was a simple and quantifiable indicator that likely captured some of this influence. In a study on biophysical factors determining copper, iron and Zn in wheat grains in central Iran, linear regression on soil and climate variables explained 26% of the variability in grain Zn concentration [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref038\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. Karami et al. [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref038\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>] attributed some of the uncaptured variability to differences in management. In this study we were able to determine management variables in farmer interviews and showed that the addition of management variables to measured field variables did indeed improve linear modeling (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t003\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 3</xref>). However, interview answers were often very subjective or riddled with uncertainty. It proved valuable to ask several related questions and see if the answers were correlated, which would suggest accurate answers (results not shown). Also, it was decided to focus on less subjective interview results, such as number of livestock per farm, which every farmer could answer accurately.</p><p>The results underline the importance of farmer training and organization. While we found no yield difference between organically and conventionally grown wheat, the local system comparison trial reported that organic were significantly lower than conventional wheat yields [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref026\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>]. This discrepancy between field and on-farm trials also came forth in a meta-analysis, which reported that in on-farm studies organic yields were on average 88% of conventional yields, compared to an average of only 81% in field trials [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref016\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>]. While field trials control for possible human capital effects (i.e. the same persons with the same know-how manage all treatments), in on-farm reality organic and conventional farmer populations may have different motivations, beliefs, and know-how [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref027\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. Especially in developing countries, training received upon certification is often highly valued by farmers [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref051\" ref-type=\"bibr\">51</xref>]. In our study, nutrient management training significantly increased predicted yield (<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.t003\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 3</xref>). Better training of conventional farmers would thus likely increase conventional farmer yields to levels reported in the system comparison trial (up to 4200 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref026\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>]. However, this would likely come along with reduced grain Zn concentrations due to yield dilution (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0160729.g006\">Fig 6A</xref>) if farmers do not adopt more Zn-efficient cultivars and or start applying Zn fertilizers. Field studies in Punjab have shown that Zn fertilization may increase both crop yield and grain Zn concentration [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref002\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref052\" ref-type=\"bibr\">52</xref>]. Therefore the spread of Zn-efficient crops coupled with Zn fertilization should be pursued to further increase grain quality. In an assessment of economic performance over two full crop rotation in the system comparison trial, Forster et al. [<xref rid=\"pone.0160729.ref026\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>] report that overall organic cropping was financially competitive even at lower yield levels. From a human nutritional and a financial point of view, organic wheat cropping is thus a sustainable option for farmers in the region.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=\"conclusions\" id=\"sec020\"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting increased grain Zn concentrations in organic compared to conventional wheat cropping, where the biofortification effect is not due to decreased yield. Yields for both systems were on average around 3400 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> and both organic and conventional soils contained similar amounts of total and extractable Zn. Considering that farming practices and soil Zn conditions were similar, the benefit of organic farming could not be explained simply by soil Zn concentration differences. Management variables improved model fits and allowed our regressions to explain a higher percentage of the observed variability. With a model considering yield, soil available P, grain N, cropping system and farmyard manure availability, we were able to explain 46% of the variability in grain Zn concentration of the 60 farms. The analyses revealed that training gave organic farmers an edge and allowed them to produce higher quality wheat grains at the same yield level. Organic farmers&#x02019; improved agricultural management was seen in a higher nutrient efficiency, as organic grains accumulated more Zn, N, and S despite similar soil nutrient concentrations, and the same yield despite tending to have lower soil available P. Due to higher grain Zn concentration and same yield, organic wheat farming thus has a potential to improve livelihoods in the region.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"supplementary-material\" id=\"sec021\"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0160729.s001\"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Exact interview question and answer type for each interview variable mentioned.</title><p>Interviews were conducted face-to-face based on a structured, written questionnaire.

It can be seen e.g. in the prevalence of stunted growth in children, which is estimated to affect 61 million children in India under 5 years of age [1]. At the same time, low Zn availability in soils may limit crop yield [4]. In India Zn deficiency is particularly prevalent in Alfisols, Vertisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols, and leached Ultisols [5]. Under low Zn conditions, plant growth is severely reduced and other plant functions are disrupted, as may be expressed in increased susceptibility to diseases [6]. Furthermore, with an annual production of almost 1011 kg India is the second biggest producer of wheat globally, with most wheat being produced by the northern and central states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh [7]. In these states wheat is also the main staple crop [3]. Research on increasing soil availability and grain Zn concentration in wheat is thus of great importance in India, as it 1) has the potential to alleviate health problems in humans associated with Zn deficiency and 2) may increase agricultural yields.\\n\\nThere are two main approaches for increasing grain Zn concentration: biofortification through crop breeding and agronomic biofortification through Zn fertilizer application [8]. Breeding efforts, led by HarvestPlus and the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT), set the goal to increase grain Zn concentration in wheat from 25 to 37 mg kg-1 [9]. Several studies have shown that Zn fertilization, especially foliar application, is an effective way to increase grain Zn concentration [2,10]. Ram et al. (2015) reported over 100% increases in wheat grain Zn concentration from 25–33 mg kg-1 to 63–70 mg kg-1, coupled with significant yield increases, following soil and foliar application of Zn fertilizers on field trials in Punjab [2]. Since grain Zn accumulation is related to soil Zn availability, enhancing soil Zn availability can also increase Zn concentration in cereal grains [8]. A third approach for increasing cereal grain Zn concentrations–that has received much less attention–is biofortification through organic matter management [11].\\n\\nTogether with pH, clay content, and concentrations of other nutrients (especially N and P), organic matter is one of the most important factors determining Zn availability in soils [12,13]. Zn availability may decrease with increasing soil organic matter content, as organic matter binds Zn [14]. However, other studies observed a positive correlation between DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid)-extractable Zn and organic matter across different soils, as organic matter may also be a source of exchangeable Zn [5]. Thus it is conceivable that organic matter management may present a possibility for biofortification. While farmyard manure is a major source of Zn in agricultural systems [15], addition of green manure (fresh plant residues) in pot studies was also shown to significantly improve the plant-available fraction of Zn in the soil and increase wheat grain concentrations from 20 to 31 mg kg-1 [11].\\n\\nDo organically grown cereals contain higher concentrations of Zn? Since organic agriculture relies on substantial inputs of organic matter in the form of farmyard manure, compost, or leguminous cover crops, it could potentially increase Zn concentration in the grains. While several studies have looked at yield [16] or economic performance [17] of organic farms, few studies have compared organic and conventional farming in terms of Zn biofortification. Organic farming has been shown to incur higher organic matter contents and increased soil biological activity [18,19]; however, crop yields are generally lower [16]. Zn concentration in organically grown wheat on low-P soils in Australia was found to be higher, likely associated to increased mycorrhizal colonization, but the yields on organic farms were 17–84% lower [20]. It is well known that yield correlates negatively with grain Zn concentration [21]. Therefore it could be argued that dilution due to higher yield explains the relatively lower Zn concentration seen in conventional Australian farms. Accordingly, a study in Switzerland found no significant differences in grain Zn concentration in organically and conventionally grown wheat at a smaller yield difference of only 14% [22].\\n\\nIn this study we compared organic and conventional wheat cropping systems in terms of grain Zn concentration in a region with low soil Zn availability and where Zn malnutrition is a relevant human health problem. While in a first step soil extractable Zn concentration, wheat yield, and grain Zn concentration are compared between the two systems, in a second step the variability is explored through multiple linear regressions. We thus present possible drivers of extractable Zn concentration, wheat yield, and wheat grain Zn concentration. Our hypotheses were that organic cropping systems had: 1) higher extractable soil Zn concentrations, 2) lower yields, and 3) higher grain Zn concentrations.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\n\\nSite description\\n\\nThe Nimar District of Madhya Pradesh, India (Fig 1) was chosen for this study due to a well-established network of organic farmers, and the importance of wheat production in the area. According to UNICEF and the World Health Organization, Madhya Pradesh has childhood stunting levels of 50% and the highest prevalence of wasting (children under 5 whose weight is more than 2 standard deviations below the global median) in India [23,24]. Agricultural soils, mostly Vertisols, in Nimar District are known to have a high pH and thus relatively low Zn availability of around 0.57 mg kg-1 [25], while the threshold for Zn deficiency in India has been set at <0.6 mg kg-1 [5]. Furthermore, bioRe, a cooperative of around 4000 organic farmers, is located in the study area (www.bioreindia.com) and provides information and training on improved organic crop management. Compliance with internationally accepted certification standards and frequent visits by bioRe staff ensure that organic practices are appropriately followed on the registered organic farms. In 2007 a long-term field experiment was established at bioRe’s research station, which compares conventional and organic cropping systems [26]. An earlier study characterized soil characteristics, yield and economic performance of 170 cotton fields in the area [27]. With a series of canals, water reservoirs and wells, irrigation can be practiced even far from the Narmada River, which is the primary source of water in the area. Most farms are between 1 and 10 ha in size; farm work, including soil preparation, weeding, and harvesting, is mainly done by hand or with bullocks [27]. While cotton and soybean are the most important Kharif (monsoon season) crops, in Rabi (winter) most farmers grow wheat.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g001Fig 1 Spatial distribution of farms.Location of 30 organic and 30 conventional farms and bioRe station in study region.\\n\\nSampled farms were selected to be representative of farms in the case study region, and with no systematic differences in organic and conventional farm locations. To minimize soil and management heterogeneity, only fields in the lowlands and with good access to irrigation were included. With respect to these prerequisites, the bioRe research and extension team assembled a list of 50 conventional and 50 organic farmers from six extension centers, in a 25 km radius around bioRe station. From that list, 30 farmers of each practice were selected randomly (Fig 1).\\n\\n\\nSoil and wheat sampling and yield determination\\n\\nSoil samples (top 25 cm) were taken during wheat sowing (November-December 2014). On each field, 10 soil cores were collected on a Z-shaped transect spanning the whole field, and combined into one composite sample, which was air-dried at 40°C, crushed, sieved (2mm) and then transported for lab analysis. Grains were sampled at the time of harvest in March-April 2015. Since not all of the farms could be reached at the same time, some farmers already harvested wheat prior to the second visit. In that case, the farmers set aside 100 g of grain sample. If the crop was still standing but ready to be harvested, 5–7 ears were collected from each of the same 10 locations where soils had been sampled. Each farmer reported the mass of grains harvested on the given field. The field area was measured using the “area calculation” application of a mobile GPS device (Dakota 10, Garmin, Schaffhausen, Switzerland). Dividing the reported mass with the measured field area served as an estimate for the yield.\\n\\n\\nSoil analysis\\n\\nThe soil samples were analyzed for pH, soil texture, total element concentrations (C, N, P, K, Ca, S, Mg, Mn, B, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mo, Ni), DTPA extractable micronutrients (Mn, Fe, Zn and Cu), available P and exchangeable K. The pH was measured with 0.01 M CaCl2 on < 2 mm soil [28]. Particle size distribution was measured with the laser diffraction method on < 2mm soil. After oxidation with 12.8 M hydrogen peroxide until bubbling stopped, 0.3 g subsamples of soil were submersed in 6 ml of 0.2% Calgone solution and shaken for 2 h [29]. The samples were then analyzed with LS13320 (Beckman Coulter, Bea, USA) using the optical model parameters suggested for soils [30].\\n\\nTotal N was measured on finely ground soil by dry combustion using an NCS analyzer (Flash EA 1112 Series, Thermo Scientific, USA). Inorganic and organic (total minus inorganic) C were measured by a combustion unit (SSM-5000A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled with a total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-L, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). For determining other total element concentrations, 1 g of finely ground soil was digested with 8 mL aqua regia (HCl and HNO3 in a molar ration of 3:1) at 90°C for 120 min and run through ICP-OES (Varian, Palo Alto, USA) [31]. International Soil-Analytical Exchange standard soils 910 and 952 were used as references (http://www.wepal.nl/). Extractable Zn was determined by extracting 10 g of finely ground soil with 20 ml of 0.005 M DTPA and 0.1 M TEA (triethanolamine) followed by measurement on an ICP-OES [32]. The amount of P extractable by the Olsen method was taken as a proxy for available P and measured following the protocol of Schoenau and O’Halloran (2007) [33]. After extraction with 0.5 M NaHCO3, the samples were measured in a spectrophotometer (50 Scan, Varian, Palo Alto, USA) at a wavelength of 880 nm against a P-standard series with known P concentrations and also containing 0.5 M NaHCO3. Exchangeable K was extracted with neutral ammonium acetate [34] and measured on an ICP-OES.\\n\\n\\nGrain analysis\\n\\nGrains were pulverized in ceramic capsules with a mixing mill (MM200, Retsch, Haan, Germany) by rotating for 1 minute at a frequency of 30 Hz. Total N and total C concentrations were measured by dry combustion using an NCS analyzer (Flash EA 1112 Series, Thermo Scientific, USA). Protein concentration was calculated by multiplying grain N concentration by a conversion factor of 5.7 [35]. Concentrations of other elements were measured by ICP-OES after microwave digestion. One mL of 14.4 M HNO3 and 2 mL of 9.8 M H2O2 were added to subsamples of 100 mg finely ground wheat grain. The samples were then digested for 30 minutes at a pressure of 40 bar and temperature up to 240°C (turboWave, MLS GmbH, Leutkirch, Germany). International Plant-Analytical Exchange references 783 or 197 were included in each digestion set and used to validate the results (http://www.wepal.nl/).\\n\\n\\nInterviews\\n\\nDuring the time of wheat sowing (November-December 2014), structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with the farmers. The interview included questions on farming practice, training in nutrient management, livestock number, use and amounts of farmyard manure, and wheat cultivar used (Table 1). The exact interview questions can be found in S1 Table. During the time of wheat harvest, some fields were still green, while others were already being harvested. Thus harvest date was noted during field visits and through talking to farmers. In March and April the weather becomes persistently hotter and drier [26]. Our assumption was that late harvest date, i.e. growth period shifted in time, implied increased likelihood of drought exposure.\\n\\nTable 1\\n\\xa0\\tmax. scope of model:\\nindicator\\tunit\\tmethod of assessment\\tDTPA\\tyield\\tgrain Zn\\npH\\t-\\tmeasured in 0.01 M CaCl2\\tx\\nclay\\tg kg\\tlaser diffraction\\tx\\nsilt\\tg kg\\tlaser diffraction\\tx\\ninorganic C\\tg kg\\tdry combustion with TOC-L analyzer\\tx\\norganic C\\tg kg\\tdry combustion with TOC-L analyzer\\tx\\nN\\tg kg\\tdry combustion with NCS analyzer\\tx\\nP\\tmg kg\\tdigestion with aqua regia\\tx\\nS\\tmg kg\\tdigestion with aqua regia\\tx\\nZn\\tmg kg\\tdigestion with aqua regia\\tx\\nDTPA Zn\\tmg kg\\tDTPA-extraction\\tx\\navailable P\\tmg kg\\tOlsen\\'s P extraction with NaHCO\\tx\\nexchangeable K\\tmg kg\\textraction with NH\\tx\\ncropping system\\t[ORG/CONV]\\tfarmer interview\\tx\\ncultivar\\t-\\tfarmer interview\\tx\\nyield\\tkg ha\\tfarmer reporting\\tx\\nharvest date\\tday after January 1st\\tnoted on field visits and through talking with farmers\\tx\\ngrain protein\\tg kg\\tdry combustion with NCS analyzer\\tx\\ntraining\\t[yes/no]\\tfarmer interview\\tx\\nFYM\\tlivestock ha\\tfarmer interview\\tx\\n\\nThe production of farmyard manure as an organic fertilizer was estimated by assuming that farmyard manure production was directly proportional to livestock units.l\\n\\ni\\n\\nv\\n\\ne\\n\\ns\\n\\nt\\n\\no\\n\\nc\\n\\nk\\n\\nu\\n\\nn\\n\\ni\\n\\nt\\n\\ns\\n\\n=\\n\\nc\\n\\no\\n\\nw\\n\\ns\\n\\n+\\n\\n1.7\\n\\n*\\n\\nb\\n\\nu\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\no\\n\\nc\\n\\nk\\n\\ns\\n\\n+\\n\\n1.7\\n\\n*\\n\\nb\\n\\nu\\n\\nf\\n\\nf\\n\\na\\n\\nl\\n\\no\\n\\n+\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n*\\n\\nc\\n\\na\\n\\nl\\n\\nv\\n\\ne\\n\\ns(1)\\n\\n‘Livestock units’, was calculated based on masses of tropical livestock in relation to a typical dairy cow (250 kg) (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/lead/toolbox /Mixed1/TLU.htm).

While the FYM indicator is not a very precise measurement, in such a complex system with incomplete knowledge it was judged to be the best approximation of farmyard manure input to the fields. The FYM indicator cannot be expected to crisply depict reality, but we consider it to be sensitive to large trends or systematic differences between farming systems compared in this study.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis and modeling\\n\\nStudent’s t-test was applied to determine numeric differences between organic and conventional farms. Non-normal data were log-transformed to meet the assumption of normality. Before transforming to logarithms, the value 1 was added to the FYM indicator. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to the three response variables \"extractable Zn in soil\", \"wheat yield\", and \"wheat grain Zn concentration\" by a stepwise procedure. For each response, we derived from our hypotheses a \"maximum-scope\" model that included all continuous explanatory variables that we expected to influence the response, along with their interactions with the categorical explanatory variables \"training,\" \"cropping system,\" and “cultivar” (Table 1). The R function step [36] was then used for stepwise selection of explanatory variables by minimizing Akaike\\'s information criterion (AIC) [37]. AIC rewards goodness of fit but penalizes model complexity. Stepwise selection of explanatory variables has been used in a similar study modeling grain Zn, Cu and Fe concentrations with soil and climate variables in Iran [38]. As we observed a non-monotonic increase of yield with exchangeable K, we added a quadratic term to the yield model. Two observations with especially high extractable soil Zn (> 2 mg kg-1) were removed for data analysis because we suspected Zn contamination during analysis. All statistical tests were conducted at the significance level p < 0.05.\\n\\n\\nEthical approval\\n\\nThe farmer interview study has received ethical approval by the Ethics Commission of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich (study number EK 2016-N-30). All interviewees provided their informed written consent. Furthermore, soil and grain samples were collected in participation with the farmers and upon their prior permission.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nInterviews\\n\\nThe interviews revealed that farming practices differed only subtly between organic and conventional farms in the case study region. For both organic and conventional farms the wheat cultivar Lok-1 was most often used (CONV: 56%, ORG: 44%), followed by HI-1544 (CONV: 14%, ORG: 20%), GW-366 (CONV: 8%, ORG: 7%), GW-322 (CONV: 6%, ORG: 5%), and WH-147 (CONV: 6%, ORG: 5%). FYM, the farmyard manure availability indicator, was 3.50 and 3.30 livestock units ha-1 for organic and conventional farms, respectively (t = -0.98, p = 0.33) (Table 2). Seven organic and four conventional farmers reported purchasing additional farmyard manure, and purchases ranged from 17–66% of the farm’s own farmyard manure production. Average harvesting dates were also similar for organic and conventional farms (t = -0.78, p = 0.45). However, only 23% of conventional farmers, compared to 93% of organic farmers stated to have received training for managing nutrients. Training had mostly been conducted by bioRe extension services and included courses on manure management and composting.\\n\\nTable 2\\nCONV\\tORG\\tt-test\\n\\xa0\\tmean\\tSEM\\tmean\\tSEM\\tstatistic\\tp-value\\npH\\t7.20\\t0.032\\t7.15\\t0.050\\t0.791\\t0.43\\nclay [g kg\\t359\\t22.4\\t396\\t20.4\\t-1.24\\t0.22\\nsilt [g kg\\t539\\t14.1\\t521\\t14.2\\t0.949\\t0.35\\ninorganic C [g kg\\t2.95\\t0.791\\t1.81\\t0.417\\t0.501\\t0.62\\norganic C [g kg\\t6.44\\t0.276\\t6.96\\t0.315\\t-1.24\\t0.22\\nN [g kg\\t0.634\\t0.023\\t0.621\\t0.027\\t0.382\\t0.70\\nP [g kg\\t0.743\\t0.054\\t0.638\\t0.046\\t1.48\\t0.15\\nS [g kg\\t0.134\\t0.0090\\t0.116\\t0.0058\\t1.73\\t0.09\\nZn [mg kg\\t124\\t4.18\\t121\\t3.83\\t0.400\\t0.69\\nDTPA Zn [mg kg\\t0.634\\t0.058\\t0.642\\t0.042\\t-0.515\\t0.61\\navailable P [mg kg\\t4.07\\t0.475\\t3.29\\t0.516\\t1.42\\t0.16\\nexchangeable K [mg kg\\t266\\t20.2\\t258\\t19.8\\t0.448\\t0.66\\ngrain Zn [mg kg\\t27.6\\t1.16\\t32.1\\t1.66\\t-2.22\\t0.03\\ngrain protein [g kg\\t121\\t2.16\\t129\\t3.28\\t-1.94\\t0.06\\ngrain S [g kg\\t1.53\\t0.0382\\t1.65\\t0.0446\\t-2.04\\t0.05\\nyield [kg ha\\t3370\\t181\\t3350\\t137\\t0.08\\t0.94\\nharvest date [day]\\t74.7\\t1.80\\t76.9\\t2.13\\t-0.766\\t0.45\\nFYM\\t3.30\\t0.660\\t3.50\\t0.435\\t-0.975\\t0.33\\n\\n\\nSoils\\n\\nTotal and extractable Zn concentrations in the soil did not differ significantly between organic and conventional systems (Fig 2A and 2B). Mean total soil Zn was around 122 mg kg-1 for both systems, with a standard deviation of 21.8 mg kg-1. Despite the large pool of total Zn, only 0.64 ± 0.27 mg kg-1 was DTPA-extractable. According to the optimal regression models, total soil Zn and total soil S best predicted DTPA-extractable Zn and explained 25% of the variability in the response (Table 3). Inclusion of management variables, cropping system or FYM, did not improve the model.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g002Fig 2 Boxplots of a) total soil Zn, b) DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid)-extractable soil Zn concentration, c) wheat yield, and d) wheat grain Zn concentration for 30 organic and 30 conventional farms.

The mean pH of both organic and conventional soils was around 7.2 (Table 2). Soil texture was also not significantly different. Both organic and conventionally managed soils had total N concentrations of around 0.63 ± 0.13 g kg-1. Mean total P and total S tended to be higher in conventional soils, but were not significantly different to organic. Conventional soils also tended to contain more Olsen P; mean extractable P was 4.1 mg kg-1 for conventional and 3.3 for organic (t = 1.4, p = 0.16). Mean exchangeable K was around 260 ± 110 mg kg-1 for both cropping systems. Means, standard errors, and t-tests for additional soil parameters can be found in S2–S4 Tables.\\n\\n\\nYield\\n\\nOrganic and conventional farmers attained mean yields of 3350 and 3370 kg ha-1, respectively (t = 0.08, p = 0.94). Conventional farmers who stated to having received training in nutrient management tended to attain higher yields than conventional farmers without training (t = -1.5, p = 0.16). Despite similar means for organic and conventional farms, the yield of conventional farms tended to be more variable (Fig 2C), although the variances did not differ significantly (Brown-Forsythe test statistic = 3.2, p = 0.079; Levene test statistic = 3.8, p = 0.055). If only soil variables were considered, a regression model accounting for available P, exchangeable K, and silt gave the best yield predictions with an adjusted R2 of 0.24. Including management variables (training and harvest date) further improved the fit to the data (adjusted R2 0.42, Table 3). The model included a significant interaction effect of training with log(available P): yield depended more strongly on log(available P) for untrained compared with trained farmers (Table 3).\\n\\n\\nGrains\\n\\nWheat grains from organic farms had significantly greater Zn concentrations than conventionally grown wheat grains (t = -2.2, p = 0.03) (Fig 2D). With 32.1 mg kg-1 as compared to 27.6 mg kg-1 Zn, wheat grains from organic farms contained on average almost 20% more Zn than wheat grains from conventional farms (Table 2). Wheat grains from organic farms also contained more S (t = -2.0, p = 0.046) and tended to contain more N and thus also grain proteins (t = -1.9, p = 0.058). Other elements–C, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu–were present in similar concentrations in grains from both farming systems (S5 Table). A regression model including yield, available P, and grain protein best predicted grain Zn and had an adjusted R2 of 0.35. Including management variables (farmyard manure availability and cropping system) improved the model fit (adjusted R2 to 0.46, Table 3). The optimal model contained a significant interaction effect of grain protein with cropping system (positive dependence for organic and negative for conventional farms). The farmyard manure availability indicator (FYM) had a positive effect on predicted grain Zn (Table 3), and was significant in the full model (t = 2.4, p = 0.019). However, as a simple regression FYM was not significant (F = 1.7, p = 0.19) and explained only 3% of the variability in grain Zn.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe hypothesis that soils under organic cropping would have higher levels of DTPA-extractable Zn was not supported by the results. This may be due to the fact that there was little difference in the use of organic fertilizers between the two types of farms in our survey. Based on the farmyard manure indicator (FYM), availability of FYM on conventional farms was comparable to organic farms. The hypothesis that organic cropping systems would obtain lower yields was also not supported: both systems attained average yields around 3400 kg ha-1. The nearby farming systems comparison field experiment reported yield levels of 2800–3300 kg ha-1 for organic treatments and 3200–4200 kg ha-1 for conventional treatments between 2007–2010 [26]. Probably due to smaller management differences on farms compared to those on the field trial, we did not find this yield gap on farms in the area. Eyhorn et al. [25] also found higher or equal cotton yields of organic compared to conventional farmers in the area, despite lower organic cotton yields on the system-trial [26].\\n\\nDespite the similarities in soil conditions, farming practices, and yield level, organic wheat grains contained significantly higher concentrations of Zn. Since Zn is associated with N and S in proteins in grains [39,40], the fact that these elements were also more enriched in organic grains was consistent with the finding of higher grain Zn. The HarvestPlus target is to increase wheat grain Zn in India from a baseline of 25 to 37 mg kg-1, while maintaining a “competitive yield” [9]. A multilocational irrigated trial with elite Zn lines in Northern India reported slightly higher average grain Zn concentrations (33.6 ± 0.7 mg kg-1) but at lower average yield levels (2700 ± 200 kg ha-1) [41] than in our survey here. Organic farmers in our study thus attained statistically significant and nutritionally relevant increases in grain Zn concentration. In the following we discuss how organic farmers could have achieved this increase in grain Zn concentration without compromising yield. The discussion addresses possible underlying mechanisms for the results of our regression analysis, as summarized in Fig 3.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g003Fig 3 Schematic diagram of correlations as determined by multiple linear regressions in the case study area.Solid lines refer to positive, dotted to negative effects. While soil available P had a positive effect on yield, it was negatively correlated to grain Zn concentration. Yield also has a negative relationship with grain Zn concentration. Organic farmers had improved grain Zn concentrations because they tended to have lower levels of available P in the soil but higher grain protein concentrations. Organic farmers were able to maintain yield levels of conventional farmers by compensating for the lack of chemical fertilizers (lower available soil P levels) with improved nutrient management training.\\n\\n\\nWhat influenced extractability of Zn in soils?\\n\\nBoth total soil Zn and total soil S showed positive correlations with extractable soil Zn (Fig 4). The larger the pool of total Zn, the more is also in DTPA-extractable forms. The positive relationship with S is less self-evident. In aerobic soils, the vast majority of S is in organic forms [42], and these S containing organic molecules may also bind Zn [43]. Thus the observed correlation between total soil S and DTPA-extractable Zn suggests that S containing organic molecules are important sources of available Zn in these soils. Neither pH (F = 0.50, p = 0.48) nor soil N (F = 1.5, p = 0.22) had a significant correlation with extractable Zn, despite a known pH-dependence of Zn availability [13]. The reason why we saw no pH-effect is probably that all soils were in neutral-slightly alkaline pH range and the dataset had a narrow range of pH values. The first and third quartiles of the pH distribution were 7.01 and 7.32 respectively. Accordingly, pH was also not a significant predictor of wheat yield or grain Zn concentration (Table 3). Also, neither soil organic C nor the FYM indicator were a significant predictor of extractable Zn.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g004Fig 4 Simple regressions of log(DTPA-extractable Zn) with a) total soil Zn and b) log(total soil S). P-values for the regressions were < 0.001 (F = 14.8) and 0.003 (F = 9.39), respectively. Dotted lines are 95% confidence regions of the regression curves.\\n\\n\\nWhat influenced wheat yield?\\n\\nStepwise selection of explanatory variables revealed that available P, training in nutrient management, harvest date, and exchangeable soil K were the most significant predictors of yield. Our results suggest that P was the main yield-limiting nutrient. In agreement with agronomic guidelines for fertilization (also based on Olsen P measurement), the slope of the yield trend line decreased as available P approached 15 mg kg-1 [44]. However, yields of farmers who received training in nutrient management were less sensitive to low P levels (Fig 5A). While our interview questionnaire did not address dissemination of other knowledge, it is likely that “training in nutrient management” also comes with other knowledge exchange, and general improved agronomic practices. Most organic farmers are/have been associated with bioRe, where they receive training and knowledge from time to time, along with appropriate seed and inputs for organic farming. Some of the organic farmers are also involved in the participatory research activities carried out by the innovation platform developed at bioRe in collaboration with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture, Switzerland [45]. This suggests that organic farmers achieve similar yields to conventional farmers, despite not using chemical fertilizers, because good agricultural practice makes more out of available natural capital. The training effect also results in more homogeneous practices among organic farmers, as can be seen in the lower between-farm variability of yield for organic compared to conventional farmers (Fig 2C).\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g005Fig 5 Regressions of wheat grain yield with a) available P, b) harvest date, and c) exchangeable K. Available P had a significant interaction effect with training on grain yield. P-values for the regressions were 0.01 (F = 3.99), 0.002 (F = 10.7), and 0.06 (F = 2.94), respectively. Dotted lines (shaded area) are 95% confidence regions of the regression curves.\\n\\nThe negative relationship between yield and harvest date (Fig 5B) is in line with our hypothesis that this variable was a proxy for drought stress. The further the wheat-growing season extended into the hot and dry Zaid season, the more likely the plants suffered from drought. The relationship between yield and exchangeable K (Fig 5C) is less easy to interpret. A positive effect on predicted yield for NH4OAc-extractable K values below 150 mg kg-1 was expected, since 150 mg kg-1 is considered as the threshold below which an application of K fertilizer will increase yields [46]. Though values between 250–800 mg kg-1 are considered high, we have no reason to suspect phytotoxic effects at these levels. The low-yield points pulling the regression down for low K values are most likely due to other farm characteristics rather than a direct exchangeable K effect.\\n\\n\\nWhat influenced grain Zn concentration?\\n\\nDecreasing grain Zn concentrations associated with increasing grain yields are often interpreted as the result of a dilution effect due to a larger proportion of tissue with low Zn density [21]. Vice versa, an increase in grain Zn concentration may just be a result of a decrease in yield. For example, a study in southeastern Australia showed that organic wheat cropping may increase grain Zn by 25–56%, but at the expense of a 17–84% decrease in yield [20]. Also in our study yield showed a strong negative correlation with grain Zn concentration, but there was no yield difference between organic and conventional wheat (Fig 6A). Thus, the dilution effect does not explain the difference in grain Zn between the two cropping systems. Aside from yield, available soil P also correlated negatively with grain Zn (Fig 6B), even if the yield effect was considered (Table 3). A negative correlation of grain Zn with available P was also observed in wheat across three provinces in Iran [38]. In the latter study, Olsen P values were much higher than in our study, ranging from 10 to 165 mg kg-1. One reason for P-induced Zn deficiency can be that mycorrhizal colonization is reduced with increasing soil P levels [47]. Mycorrhizae can make an important contribution to plant Zn nutrition on soils with low Zn solubility [48]. Higher abundance of mycorrhizal root colonization in organic than conventional farming explained higher grain Zn concentration in field trials in southeastern Australia [20]. The conventional farms in the latter study applied 16–18 kg P ha-1, which is similar to the rates of P application of conventional farmers in our study (data not shown). However, since soils in our study were low in P (Olsen P values at 1–14 mg kg-1), and we do not know of any studies showing P-inhibition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi at this level, we cannot explain the underlying mechanism behind the observed grain Zn–soil available P relationship.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0160729.g006Fig 6 Regressions of wheat grain Zn concentration with a) grain yield, b) available P, and c) grain protein concentration. Grain protein concentration had a significant interaction with cropping system on grain Zn concentration; orange shading refers to conventional. P-values for the regressions were all < 0.001 and F-statistics were 17.3, 14.4, and 6.60, respectively. Dotted lines (shaded area) are 95% confidence regions of the regression curves.\\n\\nConsidering that grain protein was the only variable to have an interaction effect with cropping system, N nutrition seems to be key to understanding differences in grain Zn concentration between the two systems. Proteins act as a sink for Zn in grains [40]. While the model with only soil and plant predictors showed a positive correlation between grain Zn and protein, by including management variables the positive correlation was only observed for organic farms (Table 3)(Fig 6C). While conventional systems are usually less N-limited, we did not detect any differences in total soil N (Table 2). Despite similar amounts of soil N, N uptake by wheat grains tended to be greater on organically managed fields (Table 2). Similar to what was seen for P, this signifies a higher nutrient efficiency for organic wheat. Nutrient efficiency, not to be confused with nutrient use efficiency, is defined by differences in relative growth or yield under nutrient-limiting conditions [49]. While usually nutrient efficiency is used to compare different cultivars, we did not find any significant cultivar effects. Instead, sociological (training) and management (cropping system) variables affected yield response curve to P and grain Zn accumulation, respectively (Table 3). Higher nutrient efficiency was also seen for S, where organic farms had significantly more grain S despite tending to have lower soil S concentration (Table 2). A possible underlying mechanism could be soil biology, as it is generally accepted that organically managed soils support more active soil biology [18,19], and that N cycling in soils is largely driven by biotic factors [50]. Since N does not seem to be limiting yield (no correlation between soil N and yield), additional N lead to a relative increase in protein concentration. Higher Zn concentration is thus a byproduct of higher protein content in grains.\\n\\n\\nImplications\\n\\nIn this study we integrated soil and plant measurements with management and sociological variables to model DTPA-extractable Zn, yield, and grain Zn concentration. As can be seen in (Table 3), inclusion of management variables improved the yield and grain Zn prediction models. None of the soil or plant variables were able to explain why organic farmers would achieve the same yield level as conventional despite lower available P levels. The training factor suggested that there was a human capital effect on organic farmer’s yield. The harvest date variable also improved prediction of yield, as it served as a proxy for not easily-measurable field data. Unfortunately, we did not have the possibility to quantify soil moisture variables, e.g. by means of tensiometers, despite knowing that water stress would significantly influence yield in these irrigated agricultural systems. Harvest date was a simple and quantifiable indicator that likely captured some of this influence. In a study on biophysical factors determining copper, iron and Zn in wheat grains in central Iran, linear regression on soil and climate variables explained 26% of the variability in grain Zn concentration [38]. Karami et al. [38] attributed some of the uncaptured variability to differences in management. In this study we were able to determine management variables in farmer interviews and showed that the addition of management variables to measured field variables did indeed improve linear modeling (Table 3). However, interview answers were often very subjective or riddled with uncertainty. It proved valuable to ask several related questions and see if the answers were correlated, which would suggest accurate answers (results not shown). Also, it was decided to focus on less subjective interview results, such as number of livestock per farm, which every farmer could answer accurately.\\n\\nThe results underline the importance of farmer training and organization. While we found no yield difference between organically and conventionally grown wheat, the local system comparison trial reported that organic were significantly lower than conventional wheat yields [26]. This discrepancy between field and on-farm trials also came forth in a meta-analysis, which reported that in on-farm studies organic yields were on average 88% of conventional yields, compared to an average of only 81% in field trials [16]. While field trials control for possible human capital effects (i.e. the same persons with the same know-how manage all treatments), in on-farm reality organic and conventional farmer populations may have different motivations, beliefs, and know-how [27]. Especially in developing countries, training received upon certification is often highly valued by farmers [51]. In our study, nutrient management training significantly increased predicted yield (Table 3). Better training of conventional farmers would thus likely increase conventional farmer yields to levels reported in the system comparison trial (up to 4200 kg ha-1) [26]. However, this would likely come along with reduced grain Zn concentrations due to yield dilution (Fig 6A) if farmers do not adopt more Zn-efficient cultivars and or start applying Zn fertilizers. Field studies in Punjab have shown that Zn fertilization may increase both crop yield and grain Zn concentration [2,52]. Therefore the spread of Zn-efficient crops coupled with Zn fertilization should be pursued to further increase grain quality. In an assessment of economic performance over two full crop rotation in the system comparison trial, Forster et al. [26] report that overall organic cropping was financially competitive even at lower yield levels. From a human nutritional and a financial point of view, organic wheat cropping is thus a sustainable option for farmers in the region.\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study reporting increased grain Zn concentrations in organic compared to conventional wheat cropping, where the biofortification effect is not due to decreased yield. Yields for both systems were on average around 3400 kg ha-1 and both organic and conventional soils contained similar amounts of total and extractable Zn. Considering that farming practices and soil Zn conditions were similar, the benefit of organic farming could not be explained simply by soil Zn concentration differences. Management variables improved model fits and allowed our regressions to explain a higher percentage of the observed variability. With a model considering yield, soil available P, grain N, cropping system and farmyard manure availability, we were able to explain 46% of the variability in grain Zn concentration of the 60 farms. The analyses revealed that training gave organic farmers an edge and allowed them to produce higher quality wheat grains at the same yield level. Organic farmers’ improved agricultural management was seen in a higher nutrient efficiency, as organic grains accumulated more Zn, N, and S despite similar soil nutrient concentrations, and the same yield despite tending to have lower soil available P. Due to higher grain Zn concentration and same yield, organic wheat farming thus has a potential to improve livelihoods in the region.\\n\\n\\nSupporting InformationS1 Table\\n\\n\\nExact interview question and answer type for each interview variable mentioned.\\n\\nInterviews were conducted face-to-face based on a structured, written questionnaire.

Since the first reports of physiological evidence for hippocampal &#x02018;place cells&#x02019; <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-OKeefe1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[1]</xref> which exhibit increased firing only in specific locations in the environment, there have been a large number of empirical findings supporting the idea that the Hippocampal-Entorhinal Complex (HEC) is a major neuronal correlate underlying spatial localization and mapping <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Burgess1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[2]</xref>.</p><p>To keep track of their location when they move, mammals must integrate self-motion signals, and use them to update their location estimate, using a process commonly referred to as path integration or dead reckoning. It has been suggested that self-motion information might be the primary constituent in the formation of the firing fields of place cells <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Moser1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[3]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Solstad1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[4]</xref>. However, path integration alone is prone to accumulating errors (arising from the inaccuracy of sensory inputs and neuronal noise), which add up over time until the location estimate becomes too inaccurate to allow for efficient navigation <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Etienne1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[5]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Jeffery1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[6]</xref>. Because path integration errors are cumulative, path integrators have to be corrected using allothetic sensory information from the environment in order to ensure that the estimated location will stay close to the true location.</p><p>It has also been suggested that place cells rely heavily on visual information <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-OKeefe1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[1]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Burgess1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[2]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Hartley1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[7]</xref>. However, the question of how exactly different sources of information are combined, from different boundaries or landmarks, has received little attention in the literature. This paper investigates how place cells in the Hippocampus might integrate information to provide an accurate location estimate. We propose that the integration of cues from different sources might occur in an approximately Bayesian fashion; i.e. that the information is weighted according to its accuracy when combined with a final estimate, with more precise information receiving a higher importance weight. We provide supporting evidence and theoretical arguments for this claim in the Results section. We will compare neuronal recordings of place cells with predictions of a Bayesian model, and present a possible explanation for how approximate Bayesian inference, although insufficient to fully explain firing fields, might provide a useful framework within which to understand cue integration. Finally, we will present a possible model of how Bayesian inference might be implemented at the neuronal level in the hippocampus.</p><p>Our results are consistent with the &#x02018;Bayesian brain hypothesis&#x02019; <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Knill1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[8]</xref>; the idea that the brain integrates information in a statistically optimal fashion. There is increasing behavioural evidence for Bayesian informational integration for different modalities, e.g. for visual and haptic <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Ernst1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[9]</xref>, for force <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Krding1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[10]</xref>, but also for spatial information, e.g. <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Cheng1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[11]</xref> (see Discussion). Other models of statistically optimal or near-optimal spatial cue integration have been proposed previously <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Cheng1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Cheung1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[14]</xref>, although mostly at Marr\\'s computational or algorithmic level, rather than at a physical level. The latter, mechanistic Bayesian view, has been cautioned against due to lacking evidence on the single neuron level <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Colombo1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[15]</xref>. Our results partially account for three disparate single-cell electrophysiological data sets using a Bayesian framework, and suggest that although such models might be too simple to fully explain patterns of neuronal firing, they will still be highly valuable to our understanding of the relationship between neuronal activity and the environment.</p><sec id=\"s1a\"><title>Neuronal correlates of localization</title><p>Here we briefly summarize the neuroscientific literature concerning how mammalian brains represent space.

However, neither of the outlined place field models fully explain how place cells combine different inputs for accurate localization. The grid cell input model is subject to corruption of the location estimate by accumulating errors which would eventually render the estimate useless unless corrected by observations (see Introduction). On the other hand, boundary vectors alone (if driven solely by geometry, not by features) do not always yield unambiguous location estimates <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Cheung1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[14]</xref>. Even given complex visual information (which border-related cells do not seem to respond to <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Lever1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[22]</xref>, and of which a rat might not see much, given its poor visual acuity <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Prusky1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[27]</xref>), localization without path integration is difficult (localization without odometry was solved in robotics only recently, and is still much more error-prone than combining observations with odometry <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Okada1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[28]</xref>). For many place cells, both the path integration inputs from grid cells and observation inputs from border-related cells (and possibly others) seem to be required in order to ensure accuracy and certainty. This has been pointed out before (e.g. <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-McNaughton2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[29]</xref>), but the question of how exactly these inputs are combined has received little attention (but see the Discussion section for related work).</p><p>A further, as of yet unanswered, question is how exactly information from different sources (boundaries, landmarks, different senses etc.) might be combined. Although the BVC model made detailed predictions as to the kinds of inputs received by place cells, was fitted successfully to electrophysiological data, and matched empirical observations (such as what happens with place fields on barrier insertion), it does not propose a general principle of cue integration. In order for the model to accurately reflect place field location and size in a given environment, a number of weight and tuning parameters have to be adjusted for every single place cell <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Hartley1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[7]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Barry1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[24]</xref>. In contrast, the Bayesian hypothesis that we investigate in this work implies a general underlying principle for how inputs into place cells are weighted; according to their precision and with more accurate inputs influencing the result stronger than less accurate inputs. The biggest advantage of such a general principle is that it significantly reduces the number of parameters required to account for large datasets (see Results).</p><p>Please note that we adopt a highly simplified and constrained view of HEC function and anatomy in this paper. Hippocampal cells play a role in many cognitive functions other than spatial localization; among others long-term episodic/declarative memory <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Squire1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[30]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Montaldi1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[31]</xref>, memory based prediction <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Lisman1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[32]</xref>, and possibly short-term memory <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Bird1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[33]</xref> and perception <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Lee1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, place cells receive a broader array of inputs than just those transmitting visual and path integration information, such as odours and tactile information <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Young1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[35]</xref>. Finally, while cells from different parts of the hippocampus differ in their connectivity and in the information they receive, we believe that dealing with a small subset of functionality and anatomy suffices for investigating the existence of statistically near-optimal information integration in place cells.</p></sec><sec id=\"s1b\"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>In this paper, we describe a Bayesian mechanism of information integration in place cells accounting for place field formation.

The Bayesian mechanism attempts to account for the sizes of single firing fields, deriving them from the distances of boundaries or obstacles (H3) - thus, place cells with multiple firing fields can be modelled by dealing with each firing field separately, even under Gaussian assumptions. In the Discussion section, we briefly describe how the model could be extended by relaxing some of its assumptions, and we report applications of the extended model in the Results section. We do not claim that place cells implement any statistical equation (especially not the simplistic ones described here), but we propose that investigating their firing fields within a statistical framework can yield useful insights about the way they combine information.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=\"methods\" id=\"s2\"><title>Methods</title><p>The hypothesis of approximate Bayesian integration of information in place cells (H1) yields verifiable electrophysiological predictions.

Thus, the place field is located between the grid and the border field, but closer to the border field because it is narrower (more accurate).</p><p>\\n<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0089762-g004\">Figure 4</xref> is intended to illustrate the concept of inference by coincidence detection. The model relies on the fact that if the threshold of the output neuron is set high enough to only allow output spikes on synchronous input spikes, then the output neuron performs approximate multiplication, as required by Bayesian inference. The approximation error mainly depends on two parameters of the output neuron: its membrane time constant, and its spike threshold voltage. For our purposes, we define the approximation error as the absolute difference between the posterior mean estimated by the model, and the mean of the exact posterior according to Bayes\\' rule (the error of the posterior mean is most relevant for a location model, since the statistically optimal location estimate is located at the mean of the posterior distribution under Gaussian assumptions). <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0089762-g007\">Figure 7</xref> shows how this approximation error depends on these two parameters.

They are also postulated in a model of grid-cell based error correction, which shows how the redundant modular coding in the entorhinal cortex might constitute an exponentially strong population code - it can <italic>&#x02018;produce exponentially small error at asymptotically finite information rates&#x02019;</italic>\\n<xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Sreenivasan1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[83]</xref> (however, this model does not account for location correction using observations). The idea of back-projections from grid cells to place cells is supported by recording evidence showing that grid cell representations become erroneous, less gridlike, and expand in field size in novel environments <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Barry2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[66]</xref>; and recent evidence indicating that deactivating the hippocampus extinguishes grid fields <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Bonnevie1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[84]</xref>.</p><p>Thus, the Hippocampal-Entorhinal Complex might be able to implement Bayesian localization and maintain approximately statistically optimal location estimates through time, despite accumulating errors.

Bayesian cue integration in place cells (see Results section) might be the mechanism performing the correction step and then, after near-optimal cue integration, the corrected location estimate would update grid cells (the neuronal path integrator) through the place cell back-projections.</p><p>Phase resetting presents a plausible mechanism by which to perform this update step. It has previously been suggested that error correction in oscillatory interference models of grid cells might be implemented through phase reset, the resetting of the phase of intrinsic oscillations in MEC grid cells <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Burgess2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[81]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Burgess3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[85]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Hasselmo1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[86]</xref>. Therefore, when entering a new environment, connections might form between place cells and grid cells firing simultaneously (i.e. between cells with coinciding firing fields), to anchor the grid field representation to environmental features such as boundaries. These connections could induce a reset of the intrinsic oscillation phase of the grid cell when the grid field shifts (e.g. due to path integration errors) <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Burgess3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[85]</xref>. The changed oscillation phase would lead to a displacement of the grid field back to the center of the place field, because grid cell firing fields arise from the oscillatory interference patterns between background theta oscillations and the intrinsic oscillations in the grid cell in oscillatory interference models, with the grid cell firing rate being highest when the phases coincide <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Zilli1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[87]</xref>.</p><p>There is some recording evidence showing that single incoming spikes can indeed reset intrinsic oscillation phases in cells of the entorhinal cortex <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Engel1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[88]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Dickson2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[90]</xref>. Because a single postsynaptic potential suffices, the probability of phase reset occurring depends on the firing rate(s) of the place cell(s) connected through the back-projections.

Thus, multiple uncertainty values can be associated with each place cell, one for each place field - as in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone-0089762-g002\">Figure 2</xref> for example, in which many of the plotted place fields belong to multi-field place cells (see <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Burke1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[42]</xref> for the distribution of single-field and multi-field place cells in this dataset).</p><p>Further phenomena not explained by the simple model include asymmetric place fields that are frequently found in area CA1 of the hippocampus, and the observation that place field sizes seem to increase along the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Maurer1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[67]</xref>. Asymmetric place fields could potentially be modelled using skewed probability distributions such as the Skew-Normal Distribution <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Azzalini1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[92]</xref> as observation likelihoods instead of Gaussians, using a similar approach to the one described in the Methods section.

The skewness parameter of an asymmetric probability distribution (such as the Skew-Normal Distribution) in such an extended model might increase as a function of familiarity with the environment (time spent in the same environment), in order to model the experience-dependent asymmetry of some CA1 place fields <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Mehta1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[93]</xref>. The mean and variance of such a distribution could be estimated similarly to the approach proposed in the Methods section. Future work, and experimental data from place cells recorded over extended periods of time, will be needed to verify how well such an asymmetric model could account for skewed place fields.</p><p>It is interesting to note, with respect to the fact that the place field sizes increase along the dorso-ventral hippocampal axis, that the same field size increase has been observed in grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Brun1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[94]</xref>.

In an extended model taking into account the spatial configuration of the hippocampal-entorhinal complex, if the dorsal grid cells are adjusted to have small firing fields and the ventral ones large firing fields (50 cm&#x02013;3 m, see <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Brun1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[94]</xref>), this will lead to a similar gradient in the resultant place fields, given that the grid cells at least partially drive the firing of the place cells.

Cheung et al. <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Cheung1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[14]</xref> show that featureless boundaries alone are insufficient for unambiguous localization, and propose a similar model of Bayesian localization to the one outlined here, based on the implementation of a particle filter, and replicate some experimental results on place and grid field stability using their high-level model. However, they do not account for single cell firing field data, and they do not suggest how the particle filter might be implemented in the brain. MacNeilage et al. <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-MacNeilage1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[13]</xref> suggest Bayesian cue integration to estimate spatial orientation under uncertainty, suggesting Kalman filters (which use unimodal Gaussian probability distributions) or, alternatively, particle filters (which are capable of dealing with multimodal and non-Gaussian probability distributions) as the mechanistic implementation.

Finally, Cheng et al. <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Cheng1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[11]</xref> propose that spatial information is integrated in a Bayesian fashion, without suggesting a formal model or a neuronal implementation, and provide some behavioural evidence for this claim.</p><p>Kalman filters are possible to implement on biologically plausible attractor networks <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Deneve2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[51]</xref>, although they have the disadvantage of being unable to deal with multimodal, non-Gaussian distributions. Taking a different approach, Samu et al. <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Samu1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[82]</xref> have used a recurrently interconnected attractor network to correct path integration errors, using sensory information via hippocampal back-projections. Their model, like most attractor-based path integration models, relies on recurrent interconnections (which area CA1 of the hippocampus seems to lack <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Moser1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[3]</xref>). Extending their ideas, Fox and Prescott <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Fox1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[95]</xref> have attempted to map the hippocampal formation onto a temporal restricted Boltzmann machine (and argue that inference in their model resembles particle filtering), also modelling on a functional level but trying to adhere more closely to anatomical connectivity. However, like the previously mentioned concrete computational models, they do not model empirical data to substantiate their model. Using oscillatory interference theory instead of an attractor model as their theoretical basis, Monaco et al. <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Joseph1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[96]</xref> also use cue-driven feedback to correct location errors and to handle cue conflicts. They also reproduce partial remapping in an experiment, strengthening the mechanism the model uses to resolve cue conflicts. Cue-driven location correction is also employed in the model proposed by Sheynikhovich et al. <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Sheynikhovich1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[97]</xref>, in the form of connections between view cells and grid cells, weighted using Hebbian learning.</p><p>Unlike many of these models, apart from presenting a high-level model of Bayesian cue integration, we have also attempted to suggest a tentative neuronal mechanism that might underly the implementation of approximate inference. Starting from mathematical theory, a number of implementations of Bayesian inference have already been proposed (e.g. <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Ma1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[43]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Deneve1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[49]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Rao1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[52]</xref>), although none known to the authors in the context of HEC error correction. We believe the inference mechanism described in the Results section offers a useful contribution, because most previously published spiking neuron inference mechanisms predict anatomical and firing properties inconsistent with some empirical observations if applied to place cells. For example, the distribution population coding method <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Zemel1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[98]</xref> assumes prespecific tuning functions and a sophisticated decoding operation with unclear neuronal implementation. Inference mechanisms based on a log probability population code <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Rao1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[52]</xref> have more plausible decoding schemes, but require recurrent connectivity and global recurrent inhibition, which have only been observed in CA3, not in CA1 place cells <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Lee3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[99]</xref>, in contrast to physiological data from CA1 suggestive of Bayesian inference (see Results section). In addition, they assume specific weight matrices for statistical optimality - which could be learned in principle, but would require a non-Hebbian learning rule. Finally, probabilistic population codes (PPC) have been widely used in modelling inference <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Ma2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[50]</xref>, recently also supported by physiological data <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Yang1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[100]</xref>. However, PPCs have no clear way to implement learning <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Fiser1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[101]</xref>, and they also require recurrent connections <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Ma2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[50]</xref>. Furthermore, the standard PPC inference scheme assumes Poisson-like variability to allow simple addition to implement inference <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Ma1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[43]</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Ma2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[50]</xref>, which implies a direct relationship between the absolute firing rates of neurons in a PPC and the uncertainty (standard deviation) of the encoded distribution - a relationship predicted by most inference schemes. However, it has been observed that place cell firing rates increase with the animals movement speed <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Maurer1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[67]</xref> - if place cells used a PPC with Poisson variability, or any other probabilistic encoding scheme predicting such a relationship, this would imply that the faster they would run, the more certain they would become of their location (location uncertainty would decrease with increasing running speed), which is counter-intuitive and contradicts the frequently observed trade-off between speed and accuracy <xref rid=\"pone.0089762-Hancock1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">[102]</xref>.</p><p>The model we propose has its own shortcomings, but is simple and does not depend on specific weight matrices or variability distributions.

Since the first reports of physiological evidence for hippocampal ‘place cells’ [1] which exhibit increased firing only in specific locations in the environment, there have been a large number of empirical findings supporting the idea that the Hippocampal-Entorhinal Complex (HEC) is a major neuronal correlate underlying spatial localization and mapping [2].\\n\\nTo keep track of their location when they move, mammals must integrate self-motion signals, and use them to update their location estimate, using a process commonly referred to as path integration or dead reckoning. It has been suggested that self-motion information might be the primary constituent in the formation of the firing fields of place cells [3], [4]. However, path integration alone is prone to accumulating errors (arising from the inaccuracy of sensory inputs and neuronal noise), which add up over time until the location estimate becomes too inaccurate to allow for efficient navigation [5], [6]. Because path integration errors are cumulative, path integrators have to be corrected using allothetic sensory information from the environment in order to ensure that the estimated location will stay close to the true location.\\n\\nIt has also been suggested that place cells rely heavily on visual information [1], [2], [7]. However, the question of how exactly different sources of information are combined, from different boundaries or landmarks, has received little attention in the literature. This paper investigates how place cells in the Hippocampus might integrate information to provide an accurate location estimate. We propose that the integration of cues from different sources might occur in an approximately Bayesian fashion; i.e. that the information is weighted according to its accuracy when combined with a final estimate, with more precise information receiving a higher importance weight. We provide supporting evidence and theoretical arguments for this claim in the Results section. We will compare neuronal recordings of place cells with predictions of a Bayesian model, and present a possible explanation for how approximate Bayesian inference, although insufficient to fully explain firing fields, might provide a useful framework within which to understand cue integration. Finally, we will present a possible model of how Bayesian inference might be implemented at the neuronal level in the hippocampus.\\n\\nOur results are consistent with the ‘Bayesian brain hypothesis’ [8]; the idea that the brain integrates information in a statistically optimal fashion. There is increasing behavioural evidence for Bayesian informational integration for different modalities, e.g. for visual and haptic [9], for force [10], but also for spatial information, e.g. [11] (see Discussion). Other models of statistically optimal or near-optimal spatial cue integration have been proposed previously [11]–[14], although mostly at Marr's computational or algorithmic level, rather than at a physical level. The latter, mechanistic Bayesian view, has been cautioned against due to lacking evidence on the single neuron level [15]. Our results partially account for three disparate single-cell electrophysiological data sets using a Bayesian framework, and suggest that although such models might be too simple to fully explain patterns of neuronal firing, they will still be highly valuable to our understanding of the relationship between neuronal activity and the environment.\\n\\n\\nNeuronal correlates of localization\\n\\nHere we briefly summarize the neuroscientific literature concerning how mammalian brains represent space. Most of these results come from animal (rat, and to a lesser extent, monkey) cellular recording studies, although there is some recent evidence substantiating the existence of these cell types in humans.\\n\\nFour types of cells play an important role for allocentric spatial representations in mammalian brains:\\n\\n\\nGrid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex show increased firing at multiple locations, regularly positioned in a grid across the environment consisting of equilateral triangles [16]. Grids from neighbouring cells share the same orientation, but have different and randomly distributed offsets, meaning that a small number of them can cover an entire environment. It has also been suggested that grid cells play a major role in path integration, their activation being updated depending on the animal's movement speed and direction [2], [16]–[18]. There is evidence to suggest that they exist not only in mammals, but also in the human entorhinal cortex (EC) [19].\\n\\n\\nHead-direction cells fire whenever the animal's head is pointing in a certain direction. The primary circuit responsible for head direction signals projects from the dorsal tegmental nucleus to the lateral mammillary nucleus, anterior thalamus and postsubiculum, terminating in the entorhinal cortex [20]. There is evidence that head direction cells exist in the human brain within the medial parietal cortex [21].\\n\\n\\nBorder cells and boundary vector cells (BVCs), which are cells with boundary related firing properties. The former [22], [23] seem to fire in proximity to environment boundaries, while the firing of the latter [2], [24] depends on boundary proximity as well as direction relative to the mammal's head. Cells with these properties have been found in the mammalian subiculum and entorhinal cortex [22], [23], and there is also some behavioural evidence substantiating their existence in humans [24].\\n\\n\\nPlace cells are pyramidal cells in the hippocampus which exhibit strongly increased firing in specific spatial locations, largely independent from orientation in open environments [2], [25], thus providing a representation of an animal's (or human's [26]) location in the environment. A possible explanation for the formation of place fields (the areas of the environment in which place cells show increased firing) is that they emerge from a combination of grid cell inputs on different scales [3], [4]. It has also been proposed that place fields might be mainly driven by environmental geometry, arising from a sum of boundary vector cell inputs [7], [24]. This model has successfully accounted for a number of empirical observations, e.g. the effects of environment deformations [7], or of inserting a barrier into an environment, on place fields [24].\\n\\nHippocampal place cells play a prominent role in navigation, the association of episodic memories with places, and other important spatio-cognitive functions, which might be impaired if their place fields were inaccurate. However, neither of the outlined place field models fully explain how place cells combine different inputs for accurate localization. The grid cell input model is subject to corruption of the location estimate by accumulating errors which would eventually render the estimate useless unless corrected by observations (see Introduction). On the other hand, boundary vectors alone (if driven solely by geometry, not by features) do not always yield unambiguous location estimates [14]. Even given complex visual information (which border-related cells do not seem to respond to [22], and of which a rat might not see much, given its poor visual acuity [27]), localization without path integration is difficult (localization without odometry was solved in robotics only recently, and is still much more error-prone than combining observations with odometry [28]). For many place cells, both the path integration inputs from grid cells and observation inputs from border-related cells (and possibly others) seem to be required in order to ensure accuracy and certainty. This has been pointed out before (e.g. [29]), but the question of how exactly these inputs are combined has received little attention (but see the Discussion section for related work).\\n\\nA further, as of yet unanswered, question is how exactly information from different sources (boundaries, landmarks, different senses etc.) might be combined. Although the BVC model made detailed predictions as to the kinds of inputs received by place cells, was fitted successfully to electrophysiological data, and matched empirical observations (such as what happens with place fields on barrier insertion), it does not propose a general principle of cue integration. In order for the model to accurately reflect place field location and size in a given environment, a number of weight and tuning parameters have to be adjusted for every single place cell [7], [24]. In contrast, the Bayesian hypothesis that we investigate in this work implies a general underlying principle for how inputs into place cells are weighted; according to their precision and with more accurate inputs influencing the result stronger than less accurate inputs. The biggest advantage of such a general principle is that it significantly reduces the number of parameters required to account for large datasets (see Results).\\n\\nPlease note that we adopt a highly simplified and constrained view of HEC function and anatomy in this paper. Hippocampal cells play a role in many cognitive functions other than spatial localization; among others long-term episodic/declarative memory [30], [31], memory based prediction [32], and possibly short-term memory [33] and perception [34]. Furthermore, place cells receive a broader array of inputs than just those transmitting visual and path integration information, such as odours and tactile information [35]. Finally, while cells from different parts of the hippocampus differ in their connectivity and in the information they receive, we believe that dealing with a small subset of functionality and anatomy suffices for investigating the existence of statistically near-optimal information integration in place cells.\\n\\n\\nHypotheses\\n\\nIn this paper, we describe a Bayesian mechanism of information integration in place cells accounting for place field formation. This mechanism rests on the following hypotheses:\\n\\n\\nH1. Some Hippocampal place cells perform approximate Bayesian cue integration - they combine different sources of information in an approximately Bayes-optimal fashion, weighting inputs according to their precision. This means that when sensory inputs change, some place fields should shift and resize in a manner predictable by a Bayesian model.\\n\\n\\nH2. A Bayesian view requires that HEC neurons encode a mammal's uncertainty regarding its position, in addition to its actual location. We hypothesize that the sizes of place cell firing fields are correlated with this location uncertainty.\\n\\n\\nH3. The uncertainty of distance measurements to borders  depends on the boundary distance , and can be approximated by a linear relationship using some constant  (cf. Weber's law): . There is some physiological evidence for this in border-related cells [22], [23], as well as some behavioural evidence that Weber's law holds for spatial distance perception in rats [36] and mammals [37]. That the tuning breadths of BVCs should increase with distance is also a prerequisite of the Boundary Vector Cell model [7], [24], has been successfully fit to neuronal and behavioural data, and is supported by physiological evidence [22].\\n\\nThese hypotheses are interdependent, and will be investigated together. To generate verifiable predictions from the Bayesian hypothesis (H1) we need to assume how uncertainty is represented (H2) and how it can be derived from the geometry of the environment (H3). Together, these hypotheses allow the making of predictions about the sizes of place cell firing fields, given the distances of all boundaries, in some cases using just a single parameter specifying how uncertainty depends on distance. The Bayesian mechanism attempts to account for the sizes of single firing fields, deriving them from the distances of boundaries or obstacles (H3) - thus, place cells with multiple firing fields can be modelled by dealing with each firing field separately, even under Gaussian assumptions. In the Discussion section, we briefly describe how the model could be extended by relaxing some of its assumptions, and we report applications of the extended model in the Results section. We do not claim that place cells implement any statistical equation (especially not the simplistic ones described here), but we propose that investigating their firing fields within a statistical framework can yield useful insights about the way they combine information.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nThe hypothesis of approximate Bayesian integration of information in place cells (H1) yields verifiable electrophysiological predictions. Since we hypothesized that place cells can perform approximate Bayesian cue integration (H1), and place field sizes are correlated with uncertainty (H2), and that uncertainty depends on distance (H3), expected place field sizes can be predicted from the geometry of an environment using a Bayesian model. This section will outline such a Bayesian model.\\n\\n\\nModel assumptions\\n\\nTo simplify the mathematics, and because this assumption fits our data well, we will assume elliptical firing fields shaped like two-dimensional Gaussians. We do not claim that place cells encode exact Gaussian distributions (there are also asymmetric place fields in the hippocampus - see the Discussion for potential extensions of this simple model). However, investigating their firing fields in a Bayesian framework can yield useful insights about cue integration. The predictions in the Results section are generated from Bayesian models using Gaussian probability distributions to represent locations, in simplified two-dimensional environments, with sizes and distances adjusted to those of the respective in-vivo experiments.\\n\\n\\nBayesian spatial cue integration\\n\\nBayesian inference under Gaussian assumptions implies that information from different observations should be weighted according to its accuracy. This claim can be formalized using Bayes' rule, according to which the probability distribution of the location given a number of observations can be calculated from(1)where  is the animals location in the environment and  represents a set of  observations.  is the posterior location belief, given all observations.  is a prior belief over the location (for example via path integration), and  represents the probability of the current observations given  (such as boundaries or landmarks), characterized by the distance from  and their uncertainty (see below). Since observations can be assumed to be conditionally independent given the location (this is an assumption commonly made in robotics, see [38], [39]), we can expand equation (1) to(2)\\n\\nIn this simplified model, the probability distributions are assumed to be Gaussian. Thus, for multiple spatial dimensions, equation (2) can be written as(3)\\n\\nIn the case of a single spatial dimension, and in environments where spatial dimensions can be assumed to be independent and thus can be considered separately, equation (2) can be written as(4)\\n\\nHere,  (or  in one dimension) is the mean of the posterior or the ‘best guess’ location,  (or  in one dimension) the uncertainty (covariance, or standard deviation) associated with this location,  (or ) and  (or ) are the mean and the uncertainty of the prior belief location,  (or ) and  (or ) are the means and uncertainties of the individual observations, and  is a constant for normalization.\\n\\nCalculating the uncertainty  (standard deviation) in one spatial dimension is sometimes sufficient in environments in which the width is negligible compared to the length (such as the first two environments in the Results section: the linear track in Figure 1, and the circular track in Figure 2). In the rectangular environments of Figure 3, the  and  dimensions were assumed to be independent, and the uncertainties were calculated independently - which is a reasonable approximation for this particular dataset, since the observations (the walls of the environment) were orthogonal. However, for more complex environments, the covariances  would have to be calculated from equation (3) instead of individually calculating the standard deviations in each dimension (see Text S1 in the Supporting Information for the derivation of the covariance matrix from distance measurements, for two-dimensional environments in which the dimensions cannot be assumed to be independent).\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089762.g001Figure 1 Place field sizes, and predicted uncertainty, on an empty rectangular track.The blue dots show the sizes of individual place fields in bins (one bin equals 1.9 cm). The red lines show the location uncertainty predicted by the Bayesian model - the thin red line (bottom) represents a trajectory very close to either the top or the bottom border (which means a small uncertainty in the  dimension), and the thick red line (top) shows a trajectory in the middle of the track, far from the borders (which means a large uncertainty in the  dimension). They account for  of the place fields between them and thus explain most of the variance.

The minima of the red lines correspond to the black squares marking the positions of the objects on the track, since the location uncertainty is lowest near to an object and highest when the rat is far from the objects. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the recorded place field sizes and the predicted uncertainty was  for rat 1 and  for rat 2. The proportions of explained variance were  for rat 1 and  for rat 2.

Substituting the precision or accuracy of the prior belief  by , and the factor  influencing observation precision (i.e. how rapidly the accuracy of distance judgements decreases with increasing distance) by , we arrive at equation (7), which can be used to calculate the resulting uncertainty given a prior belief accuracy (which might depend on the path integrator) and the distances and accuracies of all observations.(7)\\n\\n\\nEquation (7) was used in the Results section to predict uncertainties (hypothesized to be correlated with place field sizes), given distances to boundaries or landmarks. Explained proportions of variance  were calculated from , where  is the sum of squared differences between the model prediction and the recorded data, and  is the total sum of squares.\\n\\nFor the data analysed in the Results section, we assumed the parameter  to be negligible -  was the sole parameter fitted to the data. The single-unit place field data on the linear and circular tracks (see first two subsections in Results) has been obtained from electrodes in distal parts of area CA1 of the Hippocampus (closest to the subiculum), which receive few connections from the neural path integrator (MEC), as opposed to proximal CA1 [41]. These recorded place cells were probably mainly driven by sensory information (subiculum, LEC) instead of path integration information (MEC) [41], [42], which is why we assumed , the parameter accounting for path integration accuracy, to be negligible for these specific datasets.\\n\\nSince the simplifying assumptions made by the model presented here are too strong for real-world environments, and since place cell firing is influenced by many more factors other than environmental geometry, such a simple model cannot yield highly accurate predictions of electrophysiological recordings. However, if place cells integrate information in a Bayesian fashion, and if the sizes of their place fields are correlated with uncertainty, then even this simple model should be able to approximately account for the distribution of place field sizes and their dependence on the distances to boundaries and landmarks in the environment. For example, place fields should be smaller close to boundaries and larger far from boundaries. In the Results section, we will compare these predictions of the Bayesian model to data recorded from rat place cells in different environments.\\n\\n\\nEquation (7) can be extended to only include subsets of observed objects (see Discussion) by introducing a set of binary variables  indicating whether a certain object observation is being used in the uncertainty estimation. If , then the probability of observation  does not influence the posterior probability. Thus, in the one-dimensional case, the observation probabilities will be(8)\\n\\nIf we insert equation (8) into equation (4) calculating the mean and uncertainty (standard deviation) of the ‘best guess’ location, and solve for the standard deviation (see [40]), we get the following extended expression representing the uncertainty depending on the distances of a subset of the observations:(9)where  indexes one of  objects, boundaries, or obstacles.  can be fitted using e.g. a non-linear optimizer or a brute-force approach - trying all possibilities - if the number of obstacles is small enough (in the Results section, we have adopted the latter approach).\\n\\n\\nBayesian inference on the neuronal level: a possible model\\n\\nThe hypotheses outlined in the Introduction section imply that, physiologically, the firing fields of place cells should shift and shrink in a statistically optimal fashion. This might be caused by a large number of possible mechanisms (see e.g. [43] for some proposed implementations of Bayesian inference in brains, and the Discussion section). We have chosen to implement a different solution for Bayesian inference in spiking neuronal networks, based on coincidence detection. We report simulation results of this neuronal Bayesian inference model in the last subsection of Results. This neuronal model rests on the following assumptions:\\n\\n\\nInference using coincidence detection\\n\\nA mechanism for obtaining a Bayesian posterior requires a multiplication of probability distributions. In a network of spiking neurons, such multiplication might be implemented by coincidence detection [44], a mechanism that hippocampal CA1 neurons have been observed to exhibit [45]–[47]. This particular implementation of multiplication is a hypothesis that our proposed conclusion does not depend on, since multiplication could also be implemented neuronally in several other ways (e.g. [48]). However, we chose this one for its simplicity and computational efficiency. Furthermore, a number of neuronal network models capable of performing Bayesian inference have been proposed before [43], [49]–[52]; nevertheless, none of these methods are fully compatible with the anatomical properties of the HEC and the physiological evidence from place cells (see Discussion). For this reason we chose to implement a novel solution for Bayesian inference in spiking neuronal networks, based on coincidence detection, and inspired by sampling-based approaches to represent probability distributions [53]–[55].\\n\\n\\nThe temporal resolution of coincidence detection is in the right range to approximate multiplication\\n\\nBayesian inference requires multiplication. Multiplication by coincidence detection only works well within a certain range of temporal resolution of the coincidence detection. If the temporal resolution is too high, very few inputs, or even one input, can elicit output spikes, in effect leading to an addition of the inputs instead of a multiplication. Too low a temporal resolution on the other hand could lead to very sparse output spikes, leading to a displacement of the output firing field and destroying the statistical near-optimality (or, in the extreme case, to zero output spikes). The coincidence detection properties of noisy integrate-and-fire neurons have been analysed in two studies [56], [57] (although their analyses are based on a simple spiking neuron model, recordings by [56] indicate that these expressions closely model the coincidence detection behaviour of biological neurons in vitro). According to [57], the temporal resolution can be approximated based on the standard deviation of the fluctuation of the membrane potential , the membrane time constant  and the amplitude  of the postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) as follows:(10)\\n\\nInserting standard values observed in vivo in area CA1 of the Hippocampus into equation (10) ([58], [59], [60], and  just under the  necessary to discharge a place cell [61]) yields around . The temporal resolution of the coincidence detection in hippocampal CA1 neurons has also been measured in vitro, and is of the same order of magnitude. For example, Jarsky et al. have found that CA1 neuron firing upon perforant path input spikes is strongly facilitated by synchronous spikes from Schaffer-collateral (SC) synapses arriving within 5–10 ms, but is otherwise unreliable if no synchronous SC input is present [45].\\n\\nThis temporal resolution constant  is small enough to approximate multiplication (see Results), but sufficiently large to allow enough coincidences to form a place field. Even with very sparse information, e.g. in rat experiments under total darkness [62], [63] in which the place fields presumably arise mostly from grid cell input, place cells might receive up to 200–20,000 incoming spikes per second (based on around 100–1,000 connections between grid cells and a place cell [4], [64], [65], and a grid cell firing rate around 2–20 Hz [16], [66]). Given the temporal resolution of , this spike rate is sufficient to elicit the empirically observed CA1 place cell firing rates of around 1–10 Hz (e.g. [42], [67]) in locations where many grid cells firing fields overlap.\\n\\n\\nApproximating a Bayes-optimal location estimate\\n\\nPlace cells should approximate a Bayesian posterior according to hypothesis 2, as expressed in equations (1) and (2). Neuronally, each border cell could represent a boundary proximity probability distribution , if we assume that firing rate distributions are correlated with probability distributions (cf. hypothesis 1). The MEC grid cell path integrator could provide the prior location distribution . Although a single grid cell cannot provide an unambiguous estimate, having many firing fields, an ensemble of multiple thresholded grid cell inputs yields a single firing field (or few firing fields) in small environments, as pointed out by grid cell-driven place field models [3], [4]. This reduction to one or few firing fields works both with additive inputs, as in most rate-coded neural network models, and with multiplications of inputs.\\n\\nIntegrate-and-fire spiking neurons are able to approximate the multiplication of their inputs by making use of coincidence detection (see Figure 4). Thus, such neurons can represent a posterior (i.e. a product of probability distributions). If we represent the spike train of each neuron using a function , which at a given time  is  if the neuron has fired a spike within the time interval , and  otherwise ( being the time discretization parameter of the model, which we set to the temporal resolution of coincidence detection in place cells - see Text S2 in the Supporting Information), then the spike train of the place cell computing the posterior,  can be expressed using the spike trains of its  input neurons, :(11)\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089762.g004Figure 4 Neuronal implementation of Bayesian inference based on coincidence detection.This simple integrate-and-fire model contains only three spiking neurons, and shows their spikes over 5 simulated seconds. Each plot shows the spikes (blue dots in bottom rows), as well as the corresponding instantaneous firing rate or spike density. First row: a simulated grid cell (pre-defined firing rate function), used as the prior. Second row: simulated border cell (pre-defined firing rate function), used as the observation likelihood.

See Text S2 in the Supporting Information for the derivation, and for arguments why this expression approximates multiplication. Using equation (11), we can express the probability  that the rat is on a path between the locations  and  during  time intervals of duration  (represented by ), using the spike train of a place cell presumably representing the outcome of the Bayesian inference process , the spike trains representing of  grid cells , and the spike trains of  border cells :(12)(13)\\n\\n\\nEquations (12) and (13) describe how Bayesian inference can be implemented in a spiking neuronal network, approximating the posterior probability distributions with spikes of the place cell which are viewed as samples of that distribution (see Text S2 in the Supporting Information for the derivation, and for a formulation of coincidence detection as rejection sampling; and see Figure 4 for simulation results using integrate-and-fire spiking neurons).\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nPlace field sizes on a linear track\\n\\n\\nFigure 1 shows this prediction of the Bayesian model in a rectangular environment, and compares it to single-unit recordings of the place cells in area CA1 of the hippocampus of ten male Lister Hooded rats (data from [68]). The rats ran on a narrow rectangular track with food cups at both ends. These sizes were also used to generate the model predictions. In the following, x denotes the distance of the rat from the eastern boundary,  the distance from the southern boundary, and  and  the constant length and width of the environment ([68]). The model was instantiated with the four boundaries of the environment, and the uncertainty at each point of the track calculated by multiplying the separately calculated  and  uncertainties , which are assumed to be independent on this track (see Methods).(14)\\n\\nThe y-axis of Figure 1 shows the total place field area of the recorded place cells, in bins of 1.9 cm. Under the hypothesis that uncertainty is correlated with place field size (H2), equation (14) implies that the biggest place fields should be in the center of the track. Since both the distance from the east boundary and from the north boundary influence the uncertainty, it also implies that at each position along the length of the track, there should be multiple uncertainties, depending on whether the rat is close or far from the side borders (the south/north border), which is shown by the two red lines in Figure 1 (the thin red line corresponds to the rat running close to the south/north border, and the thick red line to it running in the center, far from those borders). The parameter  in equation (14) was adjusted using a coordinate descent algorithm. Using this single parameter, the model can explain why place fields were bigger when closer to the center of the track. Most of the recorded place field sizes () fall between the boundaries of the model.\\n\\n\\nPlace field sizes on a circular track with objects\\n\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the results of the model in a more complex environment, comparing the sizes of place fields of recorded place cells of two male Fischer-344 rats in an experiment performed by Burke et al. [42], in which the rats were running on a circular track with 106.7 cm diameter and 15 cm width. The track contained a barrier with food trays on each side to motivate the rats to run along the track, alternating between clockwise and counter-clockwise laps. It also contained 8 randomly distributed objects, and was otherwise featureless. The Bayesian model, equation (7), was fitted to the recorded data, using  observations (the 8 objects, and the barrier). Uncertainty was calculated in one spatial dimension, which corresponds to the distance of the rat from the barrier along the track.\\n\\nThe single-parameter model achieved correlations of  for rat 1 and  for rat 2 between the smoothed place field sizes and the fitted model - see Figure 2 (the probabilities of getting correlations as large as these values by random chance are negligible:  for rat 1 and  for rat 2). The average place field sizes clearly have a non-random structure, with the minima corresponding to the locations of the 8 objects and the barrier, as predicted by the Bayesian model (the null hypothesis of the data being random can be rejected with high confidence, with  for the two rats according to a chi-square goodness-of-fit test of the place field size data against a normal distribution).\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is plausible that the residual errors, i.e. the model subtracted from the average place field sizes, are randomly drawn from a normal distribution, implying that the model explains a significant part of the non-random structure (the null hypothesis of the errors being random cannot be rejected according to a chi-square goodness-of-fit test of the residual errors against a normal distribution, with  for the two rats). Some recorded place cells had multiple place fields [42], in which case the predicted uncertainty was calculated for each place field separately.\\n\\nIn Figure 2, the x-axis shows the positions of the means (centroid) of the recorded spikes of each place field, and the y-axis shows the size of the fields, derived by calculating the standard deviations of the spike positions. This makes these place field sizes directly comparable to the uncertainties calculated by equation (7), provided that the place fields resemble Gaussians, being approximately symmetric, and having the highest spike density around the mean (centroid). If this was not the case - if the recorded place fields were not approximately Gaussian -, the spike densities would deviate from the prediction of the model. Figure 5 compares the spike densities of all recorded spikes to the densities predicted by the model, achieving correlations of  for rat 1 and  for rat 2 (the probabilities of getting correlations as large as these values by random chance are negligible:  for rat 1 and  for rat 2).\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089762.g005Figure 5 Density of place cell spikes, and predicted uncertainty, on a circular track with objects.The blue lines show the smoothed (averaged) density of place field spikes, i.e. the number of spikes across all recorded place cells for each centimetre of the track, normalized to a mean of 0 and variance of 1. The red lines have been obtained by summing Gaussian distributions, one for each place cell, with the means set to the center of each place field, and the standard deviations set to the location uncertainties (hypothesized to be correlated with place field sizes, see H2) as above. The exact amplitude of the spike density at each location depends on the place cells firing rate, which is influenced by many non-spatial factors such as running speed [67], but the shape of the curves is comparable. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the recorded place field sizes and the predicted uncertainty was  for rat 1 and  for rat 2. The proportions of explained variance were  for rat 1 and  for rat 2. (Data from [42]).\\n\\n\\nPlace field sizes after changes in the environment size\\n\\nChanges in the environment have been shown to influence place fields. In order to show that the Bayesian model does not violate the observed effects, and can predict place field size in novel environments, we have applied it to the data presented in [7] for evaluating the BVC model, and originally reported in [69]. The data was recorded from six rats foraging for food in four different environments: a small square of size 61×61 cm (environment A), a large square of 122×122 cm (environment B), and a horizontal and vertical rectangle of 61×122 cm and 122×61 cm (environments C and D). 12 of the 28 recorded place fields were discarded from the dataset because they were asymmetric and did not fit a Gaussian distribution (see Discussion for possible model extensions). For the remaining 16 place fields, the parameters of the model were adjusted using the data from two of the four environments, C and D. The means and standard deviations of the Gaussians used to represent the place field in the  and  dimensions were obtained by using a least squares fitting procedure, and the parameter  calculated from the known distances and standard deviations using equation (7). This equation also allowed calculating the predicted place field size, i.e. the standard deviation of the representing Gaussian, in the remaining two environments, by using appropriately scaled distance relations.\\n\\nThen, the predicted and recorded place fields were compared at each point in the environment (see Figure 3). Figure 3 shows the results for environment B (the large square environments), achieving a mean proportion of explained variance of . This fit of the model predictions was compared against the optimal fit possibly achievable by Gaussian functions, calculated by fitting Gaussians to each actual firing field in the B environments using a least square errors procedure. This optimal fitting procedure yielded  on average, which is not statistically different from the model fit ( on a paired t-test over all individual place field  values). This shows that the Bayesian model can make predictions which fit the data almost as well as optimally fitted Gaussian functions. The difference between the fit of the model and of this optimal fit is statistically insignificant.\\n\\n\\nPlace field sizes from subsets of observed objects\\n\\nThe model used so far makes a number of simplifying assumptions, which yield a very simple mathematical form with up to two parameters - see equation (7) - and already provides reasonable predictions of experimental data (see above). However, the accuracy of the model can be improved by relaxing some of these assumptions, at the expense of simplicity (see the Discussion section).\\n\\nOne way to improve the model accuracy is to allow place cells to be driven not by every single boundary and obstacle in the immediate environment, but only by a subset of these objects. Equation (9) allows the calculation of uncertainties taking into account a subset of observations (see Methods). This extension introduces  additional model parameters for the  binary variables  specifying whether or not observation  is being taken into account.\\n\\nFitting this extended model to the data recorded on the circular track with objects, significantly increases the model fit - instead of explained proportions of variance  for rat 1 and  for rat 2, the extended model achieves  for rat 1 and  for rat 2 (see Figure 6). However, this extended model uses  more parameters than the original model (8 objects on the track, plus the barrier with the adjacent food trays). To take into account the number of parameters relative to the number of data points, we also compare the adjusted  values (which we denote by ). Instead of  for rat 1 and  for rat 2, the extended model yields  for rat 1 and  for rat 2 after adjustment by the number of parameters.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089762.g006Figure 6 Place field sizes, and predicted uncertainty, on a circular track with objects, using the extended model.The blue lines show the smoothed place field sizes (10-point moving average), normalized to a mean of 0 and variance of 1, and the red lines show the location uncertainty predicted by the extended Bayesian model (which takes into account only a subset of the objects on the track at each point). Pearson's correlation coefficient between the recorded place field sizes and the predicted uncertainty was  both for rat 1 and rat 2. The proportions of explained variance were  for rat 1 and  for rat 2. (Data from [42]).\\n\\nFurther possible extensions of the model, such as allowing skewed place fields, will be described in the Discussion section.\\n\\n\\nBayesian inference on the neuronal level: a possible model\\n\\nAs argued above, the sizes of place fields should be dependent on incoming sensory information, in order to approximate the statistically optimal location of the animal, and the uncertainty associated with it. Mathematically, this means calculating a Bayesian posterior (see Methods). We have already presented some evidence that place cells might be able to approximate such Bayesian calculations in the previous sections. Here we extend this idea by suggesting a tentative model of how these calculations might be implemented on the neuronal level.\\n\\nA spiking neuronal network could implement the multiplication operation required for calculating a Bayesian posterior by making use of coincidence detection. Figure 4 shows a simple example of a place cell receiving input from only one grid cell (path integration) and one border cell (observation). The place cell is modeled using a current-based integrate-and-fire neuron model [70] (membrane time constant , synaptic time constant , resting potential , spike threshold , synaptic weights ). Synaptic inputs are modeled as spike trains drawn from non-homogeneous Poisson processes, with firing rates controlled by Gaussian distributions (see dashed lines in the figure) to approximate the symmetric firing fields of grid cells and some border cells. The Brian simulator was used to simulate the place cell and to plot Figure 4[71].\\n\\nIn the figure, the place cell only fires when both the grid cell and the border cell inputs arrive within a small time window. This leads to a shifting of the place field - the place cell combines both types of information, and forms the place field at a location specified by the weighted average of the grid field and border field location, the weighting depending on the uncertainties (field sizes) of the inputs. Thus, the place field is located between the grid and the border field, but closer to the border field because it is narrower (more accurate).\\n\\n\\nFigure 4 is intended to illustrate the concept of inference by coincidence detection. The model relies on the fact that if the threshold of the output neuron is set high enough to only allow output spikes on synchronous input spikes, then the output neuron performs approximate multiplication, as required by Bayesian inference. The approximation error mainly depends on two parameters of the output neuron: its membrane time constant, and its spike threshold voltage. For our purposes, we define the approximation error as the absolute difference between the posterior mean estimated by the model, and the mean of the exact posterior according to Bayes' rule (the error of the posterior mean is most relevant for a location model, since the statistically optimal location estimate is located at the mean of the posterior distribution under Gaussian assumptions). Figure 7 shows how this approximation error depends on these two parameters. For an analytical discussion of the coincidence detection properties of integrate-and-fire neurons, see [56], [57].\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089762.g007Figure 7 Errors of coincidence-based multiplication based on a simple integrate-and-fire model.The altitude shows the error (lowest point: , highest point: , error at CA1 place cell parameters: ), and the  and  axes show the dependence of the error on the membrane time constant  and the spike threshold  respectively. Interestingly, the parameters of some CA1 place cells (, ) fall into one of the local minima of error; and no hippocampal place cell reaches the area of maximum error.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWe have attempted to highlight the usefulness of Bayesian models in explaining information combination in place cells. Although such models are too simple to explain all firing properties, their predictions fit the data quite well given their simplicity (low numbers of parameters), which is an important property of good models [72]–[74]. We have compared such model predictions to three different datasets recorded from rat place cells in different environments in the Results section, using firing field size as a measure of uncertainty. Our results suggest that the ‘Bayesian brain’ hypothesis might be useful in trying to understand information processing in Hippocampal place cells, not just at a computational level as has been suggested many times before [8]–[11], but also at the neuronal level.\\n\\nBayesian spatial cue integration has been investigated before on the behavioural level. Nardini et al. [75] investigated cue integration in human children and adults, using a paradigm in which subjects had to return an object to its original place, either given only landmark information, only self-motion information, or both. Their results suggest that adults are able to reduce the variance (uncertainty) in their response by integrating different spatial cues in a statistically near-optimal fashion. Cheng et al. [11] reviewed animal experiments, arguing that the integration of different spatial cues might be partially explained by Bayes' rule - for example, pigeons seem to assign weights to information from different landmarks using Bayesian principles. Therefore, in contrast to previous work, this paper significantly extends these ideas by directly comparing the predictions of Bayesian spatial cue integration to physiological data recorded from rat place cells, and argues for the plausibility of this cue integration mechanism on the neuronal level.\\n\\nThe claim that perception (spatial or otherwise) is based on Bayesian inference, implemented physically as a neuronal mechanism, has been criticized for multiple reasons [15]: the lack of strong physiological evidence in favour of the Bayesian hypothesis (most existing evidence to date is behavioural, coming from ‘Bayesian psychophysics’ [15], [76]), the arbitrary choice of prior functions in favour of simplicity in many of these models (instead of the choice being based on empirical data), and the ability to explain Bayes-optimal perception in cue integration in some paradigms without a Bayesian mechanism, by implementing reinforcement learning.\\n\\nIn this paper we have argued that firing field properties of single place cells resemble the outcomes of Bayesian inference processes. Following the advice of [77] we have generated quantitative experimentally testable predictions, and compared them with empirical results. Thus, in contrast with the view that ‘Bayesian models do not provide mechanistic explanations currently, instead they are predictive instruments’[15], we provide one of a few existing pieces of empirical evidence in favour of the idea that the brain might represent uncertainty at a neuronal level, and that there are some neuronal level mechanisms approximately conforming to Bayesian principles. Our results therefore contribute to the ‘current challenge for these [Bayesian] models [is] to yield good, clear, and testable predictions at the neural level, a goal that has yet to be satisfactorily reached’[15].\\n\\n\\nBayesian localization\\n\\nBayesian cue integration might also play a role in the more complex problem of maintaining a near-optimal location estimate through time, despite noise and accumulating errors. In robotics, one popular family of solutions for maintaining statistically optimal location estimates is called Bayesian localization (an example algorithm from this family would be the Kalman filter) [38]. Given some simplifying assumptions, Bayesian localization can be performed by the following three computations at each time step, in order to maintain a statistically optimal, error corrected location estimate:\\n\\n\\nPath integration. Updates the prior location belief with (possibly erroneous) movement vectors using a motion model at each time step.\\n\\n\\nCorrection. A Bayesian inference mechanism that corrects the location belief using observations.\\n\\n\\nUpdate. Finally, the path integrator's estimate is updated to the corrected estimate.\\n\\nThere is ample evidence in literature that the HEC is able to perform step 1 [17] - grid cells update their firing with each movement. We have presented evidence in the Results section for step 2, strongly suggesting that place cells might be able to perform approximate Bayesian computation. With respect to step 3, there is anatomical evidence that such an update could happen - place cells can project back to grid cells and influence their firing [78]–[80]. Such back-projections might serve the role of providing environmental stability for the grids [81], and prevent the accumulation of error during path integration [3], [18], [82]. They are also postulated in a model of grid-cell based error correction, which shows how the redundant modular coding in the entorhinal cortex might constitute an exponentially strong population code - it can ‘produce exponentially small error at asymptotically finite information rates’[83] (however, this model does not account for location correction using observations). The idea of back-projections from grid cells to place cells is supported by recording evidence showing that grid cell representations become erroneous, less gridlike, and expand in field size in novel environments [66]; and recent evidence indicating that deactivating the hippocampus extinguishes grid fields [84].\\n\\nThus, the Hippocampal-Entorhinal Complex might be able to implement Bayesian localization and maintain approximately statistically optimal location estimates through time, despite accumulating errors. Entorhinal grid cells are able to integrate movement signals [17]. Bayesian cue integration in place cells (see Results section) might be the mechanism performing the correction step and then, after near-optimal cue integration, the corrected location estimate would update grid cells (the neuronal path integrator) through the place cell back-projections.\\n\\nPhase resetting presents a plausible mechanism by which to perform this update step. It has previously been suggested that error correction in oscillatory interference models of grid cells might be implemented through phase reset, the resetting of the phase of intrinsic oscillations in MEC grid cells [81], [85], [86]. Therefore, when entering a new environment, connections might form between place cells and grid cells firing simultaneously (i.e. between cells with coinciding firing fields), to anchor the grid field representation to environmental features such as boundaries. These connections could induce a reset of the intrinsic oscillation phase of the grid cell when the grid field shifts (e.g. due to path integration errors) [85]. The changed oscillation phase would lead to a displacement of the grid field back to the center of the place field, because grid cell firing fields arise from the oscillatory interference patterns between background theta oscillations and the intrinsic oscillations in the grid cell in oscillatory interference models, with the grid cell firing rate being highest when the phases coincide [87].\\n\\nThere is some recording evidence showing that single incoming spikes can indeed reset intrinsic oscillation phases in cells of the entorhinal cortex [88]–[90]. Because a single postsynaptic potential suffices, the probability of phase reset occurring depends on the firing rate(s) of the place cell(s) connected through the back-projections. Thus, as the animal is running through the place field, the firing rate within the grid field might gradually adapt to the firing rate of the place field, and the fields would become aligned, completing the update step.\\n\\n\\nPossible extensions\\n\\nThere are some properties of place fields which the model presented here, in its simplest form, while not inconsistent with, cannot account for. The basic uncertainty estimation, equation (7), does not account for place cells driven by only a subset of the objects in the environment, instead of all of them, however, some place fields have been observed to be controlled by specific landmarks [91]. Equation (9) makes it possible to parametrize which subset of the object distances are taken into account for the uncertainty calculation, yielding a significantly better model-data fit on the track with multiple objects (see Results).\\n\\nAlthough the equations used in the Results section use a single Gaussian distribution to model a place field, this model can be used to model place cells with multiple place fields in a straightforward fashion, by calculating a separate uncertainty value for each place field using the respective distances of objects from the place field centroids. Thus, multiple uncertainty values can be associated with each place cell, one for each place field - as in Figure 2 for example, in which many of the plotted place fields belong to multi-field place cells (see [42] for the distribution of single-field and multi-field place cells in this dataset).\\n\\nFurther phenomena not explained by the simple model include asymmetric place fields that are frequently found in area CA1 of the hippocampus, and the observation that place field sizes seem to increase along the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus [67]. Asymmetric place fields could potentially be modelled using skewed probability distributions such as the Skew-Normal Distribution [92] as observation likelihoods instead of Gaussians, using a similar approach to the one described in the Methods section. The grid cell input to a place cell is usually symmetric, but the firing fields of border-related cells can be skewed [22], [23], which might give rise to asymmetric place fields. The skewness parameter of an asymmetric probability distribution (such as the Skew-Normal Distribution) in such an extended model might increase as a function of familiarity with the environment (time spent in the same environment), in order to model the experience-dependent asymmetry of some CA1 place fields [93]. The mean and variance of such a distribution could be estimated similarly to the approach proposed in the Methods section. Future work, and experimental data from place cells recorded over extended periods of time, will be needed to verify how well such an asymmetric model could account for skewed place fields.\\n\\nIt is interesting to note, with respect to the fact that the place field sizes increase along the dorso-ventral hippocampal axis, that the same field size increase has been observed in grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex [94]. Since grid cells are hypothesized to play a role in driving place cell firing, both in our model and in previous models [3], [4], this might account for the place field size gradient. In an extended model taking into account the spatial configuration of the hippocampal-entorhinal complex, if the dorsal grid cells are adjusted to have small firing fields and the ventral ones large firing fields (50 cm–3 m, see [94]), this will lead to a similar gradient in the resultant place fields, given that the grid cells at least partially drive the firing of the place cells. The role played by boundary-related inputs would mean that not every place field would fit this dorso-ventral size gradient, but on average a field size gradient could be observed in such a model.\\n\\n\\nRelated work\\n\\nThe Boundary Vector Cell model [24] of place cell firing also explains place fields in terms of geometric relations to environment features, although it does not suggest statistical near-optimality and does not make use of Bayesian cue integration. The objective fit of the simple model presented in this paper is not as good as the fit achieved by the Boundary Vector Cell model ([7] describes the fit of the BVC model to the data in figure 3). The BVC model could, in principle, also be fitted to the first two datasets presented in the Results section, but would require the adjustment of a higher number of parameters than there are data points and thus would not have a unique solution (Hartley et al. [7] simulated 2–4 inputs per place cell, requiring up to 7 parameters to be adjusted for each place cell; and a few additional global parameters - over 700 fitting parameters for the data in Figure 2).\\n\\nThe model presented here serves a different purpose; not to present a more accurate model of place fields, but rather to highlight that the information integration in place cells approximately resembles simple Bayesian computation. Our results suggest that predictions resembling in-vivo recorded place field data can be made based on a single underlying principle: the statistically optimal combination of information. Because of its simplicity, this model cannot fully explain experimental data, and does not achieve a fit as good as previously suggested models such as the Boundary Vector Cell model [2], [7], [24] (since it only uses a single global parameter for the results illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3). It has been argued that in addition to quantitative fit, simplicity and parsimony are also important and desirable characteristics for potentially valid computational models [72]–[74]. Thus, we believe it is important to consider not only models that are capable of fitting data very well, but also models that offer simple explanations, and we have described such a model, using a Bayesian framework and a single parameter.\\n\\nIt has been suggested earlier [29] that sensory information might be used to correct path integration error. Previous work building on this idea can be categorized into high-level models, suggesting correction mechanisms but unconcerned with the details of neuronal implementation, and neuronal-level models.\\n\\nHigh-level models of hippocampal error correction have proposed a Bayesian information integration mechanism before [11]–[14]. Cheung et al. [14] show that featureless boundaries alone are insufficient for unambiguous localization, and propose a similar model of Bayesian localization to the one outlined here, based on the implementation of a particle filter, and replicate some experimental results on place and grid field stability using their high-level model. However, they do not account for single cell firing field data, and they do not suggest how the particle filter might be implemented in the brain. MacNeilage et al. [13] suggest Bayesian cue integration to estimate spatial orientation under uncertainty, suggesting Kalman filters (which use unimodal Gaussian probability distributions) or, alternatively, particle filters (which are capable of dealing with multimodal and non-Gaussian probability distributions) as the mechanistic implementation. Pfuhl et al. [12] also hypothesize spatial information integration to be Bayesian, choosing Kalman filters as their implementation. Finally, Cheng et al. [11] propose that spatial information is integrated in a Bayesian fashion, without suggesting a formal model or a neuronal implementation, and provide some behavioural evidence for this claim.\\n\\nKalman filters are possible to implement on biologically plausible attractor networks [51], although they have the disadvantage of being unable to deal with multimodal, non-Gaussian distributions. Taking a different approach, Samu et al. [82] have used a recurrently interconnected attractor network to correct path integration errors, using sensory information via hippocampal back-projections. Their model, like most attractor-based path integration models, relies on recurrent interconnections (which area CA1 of the hippocampus seems to lack [3]). Extending their ideas, Fox and Prescott [95] have attempted to map the hippocampal formation onto a temporal restricted Boltzmann machine (and argue that inference in their model resembles particle filtering), also modelling on a functional level but trying to adhere more closely to anatomical connectivity. However, like the previously mentioned concrete computational models, they do not model empirical data to substantiate their model. Using oscillatory interference theory instead of an attractor model as their theoretical basis, Monaco et al. [96] also use cue-driven feedback to correct location errors and to handle cue conflicts. They also reproduce partial remapping in an experiment, strengthening the mechanism the model uses to resolve cue conflicts. Cue-driven location correction is also employed in the model proposed by Sheynikhovich et al. [97], in the form of connections between view cells and grid cells, weighted using Hebbian learning.\\n\\nUnlike many of these models, apart from presenting a high-level model of Bayesian cue integration, we have also attempted to suggest a tentative neuronal mechanism that might underly the implementation of approximate inference. Starting from mathematical theory, a number of implementations of Bayesian inference have already been proposed (e.g. [43], [49]–[52]), although none known to the authors in the context of HEC error correction. We believe the inference mechanism described in the Results section offers a useful contribution, because most previously published spiking neuron inference mechanisms predict anatomical and firing properties inconsistent with some empirical observations if applied to place cells. For example, the distribution population coding method [98] assumes prespecific tuning functions and a sophisticated decoding operation with unclear neuronal implementation. Inference mechanisms based on a log probability population code [52] have more plausible decoding schemes, but require recurrent connectivity and global recurrent inhibition, which have only been observed in CA3, not in CA1 place cells [99], in contrast to physiological data from CA1 suggestive of Bayesian inference (see Results section). In addition, they assume specific weight matrices for statistical optimality - which could be learned in principle, but would require a non-Hebbian learning rule. Finally, probabilistic population codes (PPC) have been widely used in modelling inference [50], recently also supported by physiological data [100]. However, PPCs have no clear way to implement learning [101], and they also require recurrent connections [50]. Furthermore, the standard PPC inference scheme assumes Poisson-like variability to allow simple addition to implement inference [43], [50], which implies a direct relationship between the absolute firing rates of neurons in a PPC and the uncertainty (standard deviation) of the encoded distribution - a relationship predicted by most inference schemes. However, it has been observed that place cell firing rates increase with the animals movement speed [67] - if place cells used a PPC with Poisson variability, or any other probabilistic encoding scheme predicting such a relationship, this would imply that the faster they would run, the more certain they would become of their location (location uncertainty would decrease with increasing running speed), which is counter-intuitive and contradicts the frequently observed trade-off between speed and accuracy [102].\\n\\nThe model we propose has its own shortcomings, but is simple and does not depend on specific weight matrices or variability distributions. Our aim was to show that even without additional assumptions regarding connectivity, weights, or learning, the anatomy of the Hippocampal-Entorhinal Complex might be able to implement approximate Bayesian inference. Although we were unable to substantiate this tentative model with physiological data as of yet, we hope that the reported results will encourage future research addressing the often sceptically regarded [6] mechanistic ‘Bayesian brain’.\\n\\n\\nSupporting InformationText S1\\n\\n\\nLocation uncertainty in the two-dimensional case.\\n\\n(PDF)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.Text S2\\n\\n\\nCoincidence detection as rejection sampling and multiplication by coincidence detection.\\n\\n(PDF)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Bayesian Integration of Information in Hippocampal Place Cells', 'journal_title': 'PLoS ONE'}\n",

We studied twenty-nine eyes of 29 ESRD patients by ophthalmologic examination and SS-OCTA before and after haemodialysis. The colour-coded perfusion density maps were generated and perfused vessel density was calculated. Changes in systemic and other ocular parameters such as retinal and choroidal thickness were measured and analysed. Total perfused vessel density decreased significantly after haemodialysis in the choriocapillaris; it was not significantly different in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP). Total CT decreased significantly, but total retinal thickness was not significantly different. There was no significant correlation between choriocapillaris perfused vessel density and CT. The reduction in choriocapillaris perfused vessel density correlated with the decrease in systolic and mean arterial blood pressures. The decrease in CT correlated with the ultrafiltration volume. There were no significant systemic and ocular factors affecting change in retinal thickness and perfused vessel density of SCP and DCP. This is the first study to assess the effect of haemodialysis on blood flow changes using SS-OCTA; changes may be more prominent in the choroidal compared to the retinal layer.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"FundRef\">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF- 2017R1D1A1B03030905 and NRF-2017R1D1A1B03031934</award-id><award-id>NRF-2017R1D1A1B03031934)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Yong Un</given-names></name><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Heeyoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id=\"Sec1\" sec-type=\"introduction\"><title>Introduction</title><p id=\"Par2\">End stage renal disease (ESRD) causes systemic accumulation of body fluid. The primary goal of haemodialysis is to maintain the excretory function of the kidneys. During haemodialysis, ultrafiltration reduces the levels of excess water and uremic substances and corrects the fluid balance. Haemodialysis can cause fluctuations in the haemodynamic status, including hypotension, and disturbances in the retrobulbar circulation have been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id=\"Par3\">In previous studies, the choroidal and retinal perfusion status after haemodialysis has been assessed using fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), and ultrasonography (USG)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref></sup>. However, such traditional imaging modalities are insufficient for quantitative assessment<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref></sup>. Although FFA and ICGA are the gold standards for retinal and choroidal vasculature evaluation, small retinal vessels can be masked by subsequent hyperfluorescence, and systemic side effects may occur due to intravenous contrast<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref></sup>. Thus, most recent studies have primarily investigated the effect of haemodialysis on the choroidal and retinal thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Jung <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref></sup> reported an increase in the choroidal thickness (CT) after haemodialysis, but other studies have reported a decrease<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref></sup>. Ulas <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref></sup> reported no change, but Theodossiadis <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref></sup> demonstrated a decrease in the retinal thickness after haemodialysis. Because of these conflicting reports, the effect of haemodialysis on the retina and choroid is still unclear.</p><p id=\"Par4\">Commercially available optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel and non-invasive imaging technique that uses spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) or swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) for the 3D visualisation of the choroid and retinal microcirculation. Since OCTA provides detailed assessment of the retinal and choroidal vasculature by detecting the motion of erythrocytes and visualising blood flow using serial OCT B-scans, it is uniquely suited for assessing the layer-specific perfusion status of the macula<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id=\"Par5\">Despite the strengths of OCTA, only one study has assessed the vascular changes in the retina and choroid using SD-OCTA<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of haemodialysis on the choroid and retina using SS-OCTA in patients with ESRD.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>Methods</title><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>Subjects</title><p id=\"Par6\">This prospective study included 33 eyes of 33 patients with ESRD undergoing haemodialysis at the Dialysis Center of Hanyang Guri Hospital from May 2016 to June 2016. The study design was approved by the institutional review board at Hanyang University and was performed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p id=\"Par7\">Patients with ESRD who were undergoing haemodialysis sessions thrice weekly on alternate days at the Dialysis Center of Hanyang University Guri Hospital (Guri, South Korea) were recruited. The subjects received haemodialysis sessions, each lasting 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;h, on alternate days, with high-performance dialysers, at a blood flow rate of 250&#x02009;ml/min and a dialysate flow rate of 500&#x02009;ml/min as standard.</p><p id=\"Par8\">We included patients with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) exceeding 6/60 and no history of any retinal diseases with the exception of mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Only the right eyes of patients were included and analysed. Patients with a history of glaucoma; an insufficient or excessive axial length (&#x0003c;21&#x02009;mm or &#x0003e;27&#x02009;mm); recent history (within 3 months) of vitrectomy surgery, intravitreal injection, or laser treatment; or poor-quality OCTA images (image quality of less than 60 according to the OCTA manufacturer) due to eye movements or media opacities were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec4\"><title>Measurements</title><p id=\"Par9\">All participants were examined at the first haemodialysis session of the week (Monday or Tuesday). All measurements were carried out next to the dialysis centre. OCTA was performed immediately before and after a single haemodialysis session (from 7 AM to 11 AM) to avoid diurnal variations. The systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body weight, and ultrafiltration volume were measured within 5&#x02009;min before and after haemodialysis. A detailed ophthalmologic examination including measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), BCVA, and anterior segment parameters was performed within 15&#x02009;min before and after haemodialysis. The IOP was measured using the Tono-pen (Reichert, USA).</p><p id=\"Par10\">OCTA scans were obtained using a DRI OCT-1 Atlantis&#x000ae; scanner (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). This system uses a swept source laser with a scanning rate of 100,000 A-scans per s and a longer wavelength of 1050&#x02009;nm than that of conventional SD-OCT. An active eye tracker was employed to reduce motion and blinking artefacts during OCTA. All eyes were scanned using a 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;6&#x02009;mm protocol centred on the fovea. We used the &#x0201c;remove line noise&#x0201d; option to correct motion artefacts. The &#x0201c;project artefact removal&#x0201d; option was only activated to review the outer retinal layer. The OCTA scans were automatically segmented by the included software into four en-face slabs; (1) the superficial capillary plexus (SCP): from 2.6&#x02009;&#x000b5;m below the internal limiting membrane to 15.6&#x02009;&#x000b5;m below the interface of the inner plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer (IPL/INL), (2) the deep capillary plexus (DCP): from 15.6&#x02009;&#x000b5;m below the IPL/INL to 70.2&#x02009;&#x000b5;m below the IPL/INL, (3) the outer retinal slab: from 70.2&#x02009;&#x000b5;m below the IPL/INL to Bruch&#x02019;s membrane (BM), and (4) the choriocapillaris: from BM to 10.4&#x02009;&#x000b5;m below BM. OCTA provides non-invasive, high-resolution volumetric blood flow images by motion contrast imaging of erythrocytes<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid=\"Fig1\" ref-type=\"fig\">1</xref>). This technique allows OCTA instruments to automatically generate colour-coded perfusion density maps of the choroidal and retinal circulation in a few seconds<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref></sup>. In the colour map, there is a colour-scaled bar on which dark red represents a high density of perfused vessels, dark blue represents a low density, and a spectrum of green to yellow represents intermediate densities. The perfusion density map can be interpreted numerically using the corresponding colour scaled information. The macular area of the image was divided into nine zone Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grids. The mean perfused vessel density of each subfield was measured by calculating the average of the colour information of the area using Matlab&#x000ae; (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).

Theodossiadis <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref></sup> demonstrated that the retinal thickness decreased after haemodialysis in patients with DM-induced macular oedema, while there was a less pronounced but significant effect in those without oedema.</p><p id=\"Par24\">In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of macular blood flow on the CT and retinal thickness using OCTA. Using SS-OCTA, we found that the CT decreased significantly and was associated with the ultrafiltration volume after haemodialysis; however, the retinal thickness did not undergo a significant change. Similarly, the OCTA results indicated that the decrease in the perfused vessel density occurred at the level of the choriocapillaris; there was no change in the perfused vessel density at the level of the SCP and DCP. Only one OCTA study by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the changes in the retina and choroid after haemodialysis<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref></sup>. They reported that the retinal thickness and vessel density of the outer retina were significantly decreased but the CT and vessel density of the SCP, DCP, and choriocapillaris layer were not after haemodialysis. These findings differed from those of our study, perhaps due to differences in the OCTA device (SD-OCTA vs. SS-OCTA) and protocol differences (3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3&#x02009;mm vs. 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;6&#x02009;mm)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref></sup>. We did not evaluate the vessel density of the outer retina because, if there was no retinal pathology, no visible flow was observed on OCTA in the outer retina<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref></sup>. Further OCTA studies are warranted to confirm the effect of haemodialysis on the retinal and choroidal vasculature.</p><p id=\"Par25\">In order to interpret our results, we reviewed previously published papers. Rubinger <italic>et al</italic>. reviewed 20 previous studies and reported an increase in sympathetic activation after haemodialysis. They commented that adequate sympathetic activation is an essential compensatory mechanism for the maintenance of BP during haemodialysis<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref></sup>. Sander <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref></sup> reported that sympathetic activation of the choroidal smooth muscles induces vasoconstriction and can cause a decrease in the CT. The change in perfused vessel density after haemodialysis can be explained by the choroidal and retinal characteristics. During haemodialysis, ultrafiltration leads to blood volume depletion, which is associated with disturbed retrobulbar circulation<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref></sup>. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the retina has an autoregulatory mechanism wherein a moderate change in perfusion pressure has a negligible influence on retinal blood flow<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref></sup>. In contrast, the choroidal circulation lacks autoregulation; it exhibits autonomic regulation with changes in blood flow directly related to perfusion pressure. These mechanisms are consistent with our results that indicated a change in the perfused vessel density of the macula after haemodialysis. Therefore, it can be assumed that the decrease in the CT and choriocapillaris perfused vessel density after haemodialysis occurs due to the fluid volume depletion itself or due to the sympathetic vasoconstriction of the choroidal vessels caused by loss of fluid during haemodialysis.</p><p id=\"Par26\">After haemodialysis, the perfused vessel density at the choriocapillaris level and the CT decreased to a similar extent, but these changes did not exhibit a significant correlation in this study. Instead, the decrease in the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density was associated with a decrease in BP, including SBP and MAP. However, there was no correlation between the changes in BP and the ultrafiltration volume associated with the CT. The factors associated with the changes in the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density and CT are neither constant nor correlated with each other. This is presumed to be due to the dynamic known and unknown systemic compensatory mechanisms involved in the maintenance of homeostasis during haemodialysis. Further studies are warranted to clarify these unidentified mechanisms affecting the choroid during haemodialysis.</p><p id=\"Par27\">In this study, there were no differences between patients with and without DM in any parameters. Celikay <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref></sup> reported that the decrease in the CT after haemodialysis did not differ between patients with and without DM. However, Chang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref></sup> reported that haemodialysis has a greater effect on the CT in patients with DM than in patients without DM, suggesting that the histological and autonomic nervous system changes that occur in diabetes are affected by haemodialysis.. In our study, the patients with DM had NPDR, and our findings should be interpreted in this context. Further studies are necessary to investigate the effect of haemodialysis according to the grade of diabetic retinopathy.</p><p id=\"Par28\">Our study has several strengths. First, this study differs from previous studies; we used SS-OCTA for the first time to measure the effect of haemodialysis on the macula. Unlike conventional imaging modalities such as FFA, ICGA, and USG, the perfused vessel density of each layer was measured quantitatively by auto segmentation of SS-OCTA. Second, we used the ETDRS grid using the 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;6&#x02009;mm protocol. Unlike the focal evaluation of the retina and choroid in previous studies, we were able to assess the whole macular area of the choroid and retina and evaluate the relationship between them in each subfield. Third, our measurements were performed immediately after the first haemodialysis session of the week with longer breaks over the weekend; hence, the effect of haemodialysis on the choroid and retina could be maximised, and the effects of homeostatic mechanisms could be minimised.</p><p id=\"Par29\">However, this study has some limitations. First, one of the major limitations was the heterogeneity of enrolled participants with variable aetiologies of ESRD. In addition, the sample size was relatively small. The retrospective power calculation of the current study was approximately 39%. A prospective study with a larger sample is warranted to obtain greater statistical power. Second, it should be noted that there are inevitable limitations of the current OCTA technology. High-resolution volumetric blood flow images of OCTA based on motion contrast imaging of erythrocytes is limited with regard to the choriocapillaris. Although the choroid has the highest blood flow per unit of tissue weight in the human body, OCTA can miss areas of slower blood flow under a minimum threshold<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref></sup>. Additionally, most commercially available OCTA systems display motion and projection artefacts<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref></sup>. Although most OCTA platforms have in-built software to reduce the projection artefacts, and novel algorithms to remove artefacts are currently being developed, there is no &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; method to address this problem in OCTA evaluation<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref></sup>. In this study, we used the SS-OCTA instrument with the longest wavelength of the commercially available OCTA and a real-time tracker that actively follows the fixation movements. A recent report indicated that the SS-OCTA used in this study resulted in fewer projection artefacts than other OCTA based on SD-OCT because of its swept-source light source<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref></sup>. We also aimed to minimise artefact-related variation by performing a paired comparison of images taken by the same photographer, in the same clinical setting, at an approximate 4&#x02009;h interval immediately before and after haemodialysis. Despite these efforts, we could not fully remove the projection artefacts observed in the DCP and choriocapillaris layers. However, we found that, in the same enrolled eye, the same projection artefacts were presented on OCTA images before and after haemodialysis. As we obtained paired perfused vessel density data of the same eye of the same patient before and after haemodialysis, the projection artefacts can be minimised by subtracting the vessels causing artefacts by paired comparison. The value of the vessel density induced by the projection artefact can also be offset, although it was necessary to assume that the vessels causing the artefacts did not undergo any change after haemodialysis. Tow <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the central retinal venules were maximally dilated immediately after haemodialysis by measuring the retinal vascular calibre on the retinal fundus photograph<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref></sup>. These changes may influence the results of our study. However, we did investigate capillary-sized retinal vessels rather than major retinal vessels. In our study, the perfused vessel density in the outer superior and inferior subfields was significantly different after haemodialysis. In the outer superior subfield, the perfused vessel densities of the SCP and DCP were decreased, while in the outer inferior subfield, the perfused vessel densities were increased. This could indicate that, in the outer superior subfield, a decrease in the perfused vessel density in the choriocapillaris layer may be associated with bias including a decrease in the vessel density in the SCP and DCP by the projection artefacts. However, our results revealed a decrease in the vessel density in the choriocapillaris layer after haemodialysis in the outer inferior subfield. This finding suggests that the changes in the retinal capillary vessels were not significant, that the projection artefacts were not affected, or that the decrease in the vessel density in the choriocapillaris was large enough to offset the effects of the SCP and DCP changes. Therefore, almost all subfields aside from the outer superior area could be meaningful with consistent reductions in the perfused vessel density of the choriocapillaris after haemodialysis. In addition, most projection artefacts were observed at the outer ring of the ETDRS grid. There were no vessels in the central area (foveal avascular zone); therefore, the vessel density of the central subfield area in the choriocapillaris layer was not affected by the projection artefacts. Third, our study was performed on patients who underwent haemodialysis after a two-day break over the weekend. This may have exaggerated our results compared to those of haemodialysis conducted during the week with only a one day break. Thus, our results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies with improved technology and a larger sample size are required.</p><p id=\"Par30\">Although there were several limitations to our study, this is the first study to measure the changes in the macula after haemodialysis using SS-OCTA. We found that the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density measured using SS-OCTA decreased after haemodialysis, whereas the perfused vessel density of the SCP and DCP was unaffected. However, further studies are warranted to confirm the mechanism underlying the changes in the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density and the CT after haemodialysis.</p><p id=\"Par31\">Our study demonstrated that evaluation of the vessel density in the choroidal layer using SS-OCTA may serve as a window to assess the systemic perfusion status. In the future, with further studies on the relationship among the retinal, choroidal, and systemic blood vessels, OCTA may become an effective non-invasive tool with which to identify the macular changes associated with systemic vascular diseases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Yong Un Shin and Dong Eik Lee contributed equally.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2017R1D1A1B03030905 and NRF-2017R1D1A1B03031934).</p></ack><notes notes-type=\"author-contribution\"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conception and design (Y.U.S., H.C.), Data Collection (Y.U.S., S.H., J.Y.), Analysis and interpretation (Y.U.S., D.E.L., M.H.K., M.S., J.Y., S.H.), Writing the article (Y.U.S., D.E.L., H.C.), Critical revision of the article (Y.U.S., D.E.L., M.H.K., M.S., J.Y., S.H.), Final approval of the article (H.C.), Technical support (M.H.K., M.S., S.H., J.Y.).</p></notes><notes notes-type=\"COI-statement\"><sec id=\"FPar1\"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id=\"Bib1\"><title>References</title><ref id=\"CR1\"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type=\"journal\"><person-group person-group-type=\"author\"><name><surname>Charlton</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwab</surname><given-names>IR</given-names></name><name><surname>Stuchell</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tear hyperosmolarity in renal dialysis patients asymptomatic for dry eye</article-title><source>Cornea</source><year>1996</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>335</fpage><lpage>339</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.1097/00003226-199607000-00001</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type=\"pmid\">8776557</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id=\"CR2\"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type=\"journal\"><person-group person-group-type=\"author\"><name><surname>Diaz-Couchoud</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Bordas</surname><given-names>FD</given-names></name><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>JRF</given-names></name><name><surname>Camps</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name><name><surname>Carceller</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Corneal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency undergoing hemodialysis</article-title><source>Cornea</source><year>2001</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>695</fpage><lpage>702</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.1097/00003226-200110000-00005</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type=\"pmid\">11588419</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id=\"CR3\"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"other\">Mullaem, G. &#x00026; Rosner, M.

The primary goal of haemodialysis is to maintain the excretory function of the kidneys. During haemodialysis, ultrafiltration reduces the levels of excess water and uremic substances and corrects the fluid balance. Haemodialysis can cause fluctuations in the haemodynamic status, including hypotension, and disturbances in the retrobulbar circulation have been demonstrated1–5.\\n\\nIn previous studies, the choroidal and retinal perfusion status after haemodialysis has been assessed using fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), and ultrasonography (USG)4,6–8. However, such traditional imaging modalities are insufficient for quantitative assessment9. Although FFA and ICGA are the gold standards for retinal and choroidal vasculature evaluation, small retinal vessels can be masked by subsequent hyperfluorescence, and systemic side effects may occur due to intravenous contrast10–12. Thus, most recent studies have primarily investigated the effect of haemodialysis on the choroidal and retinal thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Jung et al.13 reported an increase in the choroidal thickness (CT) after haemodialysis, but other studies have reported a decrease14,15. Ulas et al.14 reported no change, but Theodossiadis et al.16 demonstrated a decrease in the retinal thickness after haemodialysis. Because of these conflicting reports, the effect of haemodialysis on the retina and choroid is still unclear.\\n\\nCommercially available optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel and non-invasive imaging technique that uses spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) or swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) for the 3D visualisation of the choroid and retinal microcirculation. Since OCTA provides detailed assessment of the retinal and choroidal vasculature by detecting the motion of erythrocytes and visualising blood flow using serial OCT B-scans, it is uniquely suited for assessing the layer-specific perfusion status of the macula17–20.\\n\\nDespite the strengths of OCTA, only one study has assessed the vascular changes in the retina and choroid using SD-OCTA21. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of haemodialysis on the choroid and retina using SS-OCTA in patients with ESRD.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\n\\nSubjects\\n\\nThis prospective study included 33 eyes of 33 patients with ESRD undergoing haemodialysis at the Dialysis Center of Hanyang Guri Hospital from May 2016 to June 2016. The study design was approved by the institutional review board at Hanyang University and was performed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.\\n\\nPatients with ESRD who were undergoing haemodialysis sessions thrice weekly on alternate days at the Dialysis Center of Hanyang University Guri Hospital (Guri, South Korea) were recruited. The subjects received haemodialysis sessions, each lasting 3–4\\u2009h, on alternate days, with high-performance dialysers, at a blood flow rate of 250\\u2009ml/min and a dialysate flow rate of 500\\u2009ml/min as standard.\\n\\nWe included patients with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) exceeding 6/60 and no history of any retinal diseases with the exception of mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Only the right eyes of patients were included and analysed. Patients with a history of glaucoma; an insufficient or excessive axial length (<21\\u2009mm or >27\\u2009mm); recent history (within 3 months) of vitrectomy surgery, intravitreal injection, or laser treatment; or poor-quality OCTA images (image quality of less than 60 according to the OCTA manufacturer) due to eye movements or media opacities were excluded from the study.\\n\\n\\nMeasurements\\n\\nAll participants were examined at the first haemodialysis session of the week (Monday or Tuesday). All measurements were carried out next to the dialysis centre. OCTA was performed immediately before and after a single haemodialysis session (from 7 AM to 11 AM) to avoid diurnal variations. The systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body weight, and ultrafiltration volume were measured within 5\\u2009min before and after haemodialysis. A detailed ophthalmologic examination including measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), BCVA, and anterior segment parameters was performed within 15\\u2009min before and after haemodialysis. The IOP was measured using the Tono-pen (Reichert, USA).\\n\\nOCTA scans were obtained using a DRI OCT-1 Atlantis® scanner (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). This system uses a swept source laser with a scanning rate of 100,000 A-scans per s and a longer wavelength of 1050\\u2009nm than that of conventional SD-OCT. An active eye tracker was employed to reduce motion and blinking artefacts during OCTA. All eyes were scanned using a 6\\u2009×\\u20096\\u2009mm protocol centred on the fovea. We used the “remove line noise” option to correct motion artefacts. The “project artefact removal” option was only activated to review the outer retinal layer. The OCTA scans were automatically segmented by the included software into four en-face slabs; (1) the superficial capillary plexus (SCP): from 2.6\\u2009µm below the internal limiting membrane to 15.6\\u2009µm below the interface of the inner plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer (IPL/INL), (2) the deep capillary plexus (DCP): from 15.6\\u2009µm below the IPL/INL to 70.2\\u2009µm below the IPL/INL, (3) the outer retinal slab: from 70.2\\u2009µm below the IPL/INL to Bruch’s membrane (BM), and (4) the choriocapillaris: from BM to 10.4\\u2009µm below BM. OCTA provides non-invasive, high-resolution volumetric blood flow images by motion contrast imaging of erythrocytes18,22 (Fig.\\xa01). This technique allows OCTA instruments to automatically generate colour-coded perfusion density maps of the choroidal and retinal circulation in a few seconds22–25. In the colour map, there is a colour-scaled bar on which dark red represents a high density of perfused vessels, dark blue represents a low density, and a spectrum of green to yellow represents intermediate densities. The perfusion density map can be interpreted numerically using the corresponding colour scaled information. The macular area of the image was divided into nine zone Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grids. The mean perfused vessel density of each subfield was measured by calculating the average of the colour information of the area using Matlab® (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). This analysis was performed on three layers of the SCP, DCP, and choriocapillaris in the 6\\u2009×\\u20096\\u2009mm scans of each subject (Figs\\xa02, 3).\\n\\nFigure 1 Swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) high resolution single scan (A), and corresponding fundus imaging with the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid (B).

Original grayscale images at the level of superior capillary plexus (A), deep capillary plexus (B), and choriocapillaris (C) were obtained using a 6\\u2009×\\u20096\\u2009mm protocol centred on the fovea. Colour-coded perfusion density maps at each layer (D–F) were automatically generated. Numerical information about perfused vessel density (PVD) of each subfield divided into 9 zone Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid was calculated using Matlab® (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) (G–I).\\n\\nFigure 3 Representative examples of swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography showing changes in perfused vessel density before (A–D) and after (E–H) haemodialysis. Using these density maps and a colour-scaled bar, a numeric perfusion value (%) is calculated for each layer with Matlab® (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The decreased perfused vessel density in all subfields at the choriocapillaris can be appreciated qualitatively and quantitatively with the perfusion density map after haemodialysis.

The CT and retinal thickness in nine subfields of the ETDRS grid were obtained using the same DRI OCT-1 Atlantis® device (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) used to measure perfused vessel density. The CT and retinal thickness (inner limiting membrane to the outer border of the retinal pigment epithelium) were automatically calculated using a macular 3D scan (512\\u2009×\\u2009256\\u2009A scans/0.8\\u2009s) of the built-in software in each subfield.\\n\\nTwo retinal specialists (YUS and HC) reviewed all OCT and OCTA images before and after automated analysis and corrected all segmentation errors. Data that were difficult to analyse due to severe artefacts were excluded.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nSPSS version 22.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare IOP, axial length, CT, retinal thickness, and perfused vessel density before and after haemodialysis. Correlations between the measurements were analysed by Pearson’s correlation test. Regression analysis was performed to identify factors related to the changes in the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density and the CT. Subgroup analysis was performed between patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) using the Mann-Whitney U test. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nBaseline characteristics\\n\\nWe studied 29 eyes of 29 patients (12 males, 17 females; age, 39–76 years; mean age, 55.6\\u2009±\\u20099.9 years) who met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. We excluded four patients: one due to macular oedema (one eye) and three due to low-quality SS-OCT images (three eyes). The aetiology of ESRD included DM (n\\u2009=\\u200915), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (n\\u2009=\\u20096), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (n\\u2009=\\u20093), chronic glomerulosclerosis (n\\u2009=\\u20092), and unknown origin (n\\u2009=\\u20093).

In the current study, we used SS-OCTA to investigate the change in the perfused vessel density of the macula after haemodialysis, and determined the relationship between the changes in the perfused vessel density, CT, retinal thickness, and other parameters. Haemodialysis induced significant decreases in body weight, SBP, and the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density. The decrease in the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density was correlated with the decrease in BP.\\n\\nIn the recent past, several studies have examined the effect of haemodialysis on CT. Jung et al.13 reported that the subfoveal CT increased after haemodialysis as measured by SD-OCT without using the enhanced depth imaging (EDI) technique. However, the majority of studies reported that the CT decreased after haemodialysis. Ishibazawa et al.28 reported that the decrease in CT was associated with fluid removal during haemodialysis, as measured by SD-OCT without EDI. Chang et al.26 reported that the decrease in CT was correlated with the decrease in body weight, SBP, and serum osmolarity using EDI-OCT. Yang et al.15 reported that the decrease in CT measured by EDI-OCT was associated with a decrease in body weight. Ulas et al.14 did not find any variable to be associated with a decrease in the CT, measured using EDI-OCT, after haemodialysis. Several studies have reported that there was no significant change in the retinal thickness after haemodialysis in patients without diabetic macular oedema14,29. Theodossiadis et al.16 demonstrated that the retinal thickness decreased after haemodialysis in patients with DM-induced macular oedema, while there was a less pronounced but significant effect in those without oedema.\\n\\nIn the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of macular blood flow on the CT and retinal thickness using OCTA. Using SS-OCTA, we found that the CT decreased significantly and was associated with the ultrafiltration volume after haemodialysis; however, the retinal thickness did not undergo a significant change. Similarly, the OCTA results indicated that the decrease in the perfused vessel density occurred at the level of the choriocapillaris; there was no change in the perfused vessel density at the level of the SCP and DCP. Only one OCTA study by Zhang et al. investigated the changes in the retina and choroid after haemodialysis21. They reported that the retinal thickness and vessel density of the outer retina were significantly decreased but the CT and vessel density of the SCP, DCP, and choriocapillaris layer were not after haemodialysis. These findings differed from those of our study, perhaps due to differences in the OCTA device (SD-OCTA vs. SS-OCTA) and protocol differences (3\\u2009×\\u20093\\u2009mm vs. 6\\u2009×\\u20096\\u2009mm)21. We did not evaluate the vessel density of the outer retina because, if there was no retinal pathology, no visible flow was observed on OCTA in the outer retina30. Further OCTA studies are warranted to confirm the effect of haemodialysis on the retinal and choroidal vasculature.\\n\\nIn order to interpret our results, we reviewed previously published papers. Rubinger et al. reviewed 20 previous studies and reported an increase in sympathetic activation after haemodialysis. They commented that adequate sympathetic activation is an essential compensatory mechanism for the maintenance of BP during haemodialysis31. Sander et al.32 reported that sympathetic activation of the choroidal smooth muscles induces vasoconstriction and can cause a decrease in the CT. The change in perfused vessel density after haemodialysis can be explained by the choroidal and retinal characteristics. During haemodialysis, ultrafiltration leads to blood volume depletion, which is associated with disturbed retrobulbar circulation1–5. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the retina has an autoregulatory mechanism wherein a moderate change in perfusion pressure has a negligible influence on retinal blood flow33,34. In contrast, the choroidal circulation lacks autoregulation; it exhibits autonomic regulation with changes in blood flow directly related to perfusion pressure. These mechanisms are consistent with our results that indicated a change in the perfused vessel density of the macula after haemodialysis. Therefore, it can be assumed that the decrease in the CT and choriocapillaris perfused vessel density after haemodialysis occurs due to the fluid volume depletion itself or due to the sympathetic vasoconstriction of the choroidal vessels caused by loss of fluid during haemodialysis.\\n\\nAfter haemodialysis, the perfused vessel density at the choriocapillaris level and the CT decreased to a similar extent, but these changes did not exhibit a significant correlation in this study. Instead, the decrease in the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density was associated with a decrease in BP, including SBP and MAP. However, there was no correlation between the changes in BP and the ultrafiltration volume associated with the CT. The factors associated with the changes in the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density and CT are neither constant nor correlated with each other. This is presumed to be due to the dynamic known and unknown systemic compensatory mechanisms involved in the maintenance of homeostasis during haemodialysis. Further studies are warranted to clarify these unidentified mechanisms affecting the choroid during haemodialysis.\\n\\nIn this study, there were no differences between patients with and without DM in any parameters. Celikay et al.35 reported that the decrease in the CT after haemodialysis did not differ between patients with and without DM. However, Chang et al.26 reported that haemodialysis has a greater effect on the CT in patients with DM than in patients without DM, suggesting that the histological and autonomic nervous system changes that occur in diabetes are affected by haemodialysis.. In our study, the patients with DM had NPDR, and our findings should be interpreted in this context. Further studies are necessary to investigate the effect of haemodialysis according to the grade of diabetic retinopathy.\\n\\nOur study has several strengths. First, this study differs from previous studies; we used SS-OCTA for the first time to measure the effect of haemodialysis on the macula. Unlike conventional imaging modalities such as FFA, ICGA, and USG, the perfused vessel density of each layer was measured quantitatively by auto segmentation of SS-OCTA. Second, we used the ETDRS grid using the 6\\u2009×\\u20096\\u2009mm protocol. Unlike the focal evaluation of the retina and choroid in previous studies, we were able to assess the whole macular area of the choroid and retina and evaluate the relationship between them in each subfield. Third, our measurements were performed immediately after the first haemodialysis session of the week with longer breaks over the weekend; hence, the effect of haemodialysis on the choroid and retina could be maximised, and the effects of homeostatic mechanisms could be minimised.\\n\\nHowever, this study has some limitations. First, one of the major limitations was the heterogeneity of enrolled participants with variable aetiologies of ESRD. In addition, the sample size was relatively small. The retrospective power calculation of the current study was approximately 39%. A prospective study with a larger sample is warranted to obtain greater statistical power. Second, it should be noted that there are inevitable limitations of the current OCTA technology. High-resolution volumetric blood flow images of OCTA based on motion contrast imaging of erythrocytes is limited with regard to the choriocapillaris. Although the choroid has the highest blood flow per unit of tissue weight in the human body, OCTA can miss areas of slower blood flow under a minimum threshold30. Additionally, most commercially available OCTA systems display motion and projection artefacts30,36. Although most OCTA platforms have in-built software to reduce the projection artefacts, and novel algorithms to remove artefacts are currently being developed, there is no “gold standard” method to address this problem in OCTA evaluation24,37–39. In this study, we used the SS-OCTA instrument with the longest wavelength of the commercially available OCTA and a real-time tracker that actively follows the fixation movements. A recent report indicated that the SS-OCTA used in this study resulted in fewer projection artefacts than other OCTA based on SD-OCT because of its swept-source light source40. We also aimed to minimise artefact-related variation by performing a paired comparison of images taken by the same photographer, in the same clinical setting, at an approximate 4\\u2009h interval immediately before and after haemodialysis. Despite these efforts, we could not fully remove the projection artefacts observed in the DCP and choriocapillaris layers. However, we found that, in the same enrolled eye, the same projection artefacts were presented on OCTA images before and after haemodialysis. As we obtained paired perfused vessel density data of the same eye of the same patient before and after haemodialysis, the projection artefacts can be minimised by subtracting the vessels causing artefacts by paired comparison. The value of the vessel density induced by the projection artefact can also be offset, although it was necessary to assume that the vessels causing the artefacts did not undergo any change after haemodialysis. Tow et al. demonstrated that the central retinal venules were maximally dilated immediately after haemodialysis by measuring the retinal vascular calibre on the retinal fundus photograph41. These changes may influence the results of our study. However, we did investigate capillary-sized retinal vessels rather than major retinal vessels. In our study, the perfused vessel density in the outer superior and inferior subfields was significantly different after haemodialysis. In the outer superior subfield, the perfused vessel densities of the SCP and DCP were decreased, while in the outer inferior subfield, the perfused vessel densities were increased. This could indicate that, in the outer superior subfield, a decrease in the perfused vessel density in the choriocapillaris layer may be associated with bias including a decrease in the vessel density in the SCP and DCP by the projection artefacts. However, our results revealed a decrease in the vessel density in the choriocapillaris layer after haemodialysis in the outer inferior subfield. This finding suggests that the changes in the retinal capillary vessels were not significant, that the projection artefacts were not affected, or that the decrease in the vessel density in the choriocapillaris was large enough to offset the effects of the SCP and DCP changes. Therefore, almost all subfields aside from the outer superior area could be meaningful with consistent reductions in the perfused vessel density of the choriocapillaris after haemodialysis. In addition, most projection artefacts were observed at the outer ring of the ETDRS grid. There were no vessels in the central area (foveal avascular zone); therefore, the vessel density of the central subfield area in the choriocapillaris layer was not affected by the projection artefacts. Third, our study was performed on patients who underwent haemodialysis after a two-day break over the weekend. This may have exaggerated our results compared to those of haemodialysis conducted during the week with only a one day break. Thus, our results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies with improved technology and a larger sample size are required.\\n\\nAlthough there were several limitations to our study, this is the first study to measure the changes in the macula after haemodialysis using SS-OCTA. We found that the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density measured using SS-OCTA decreased after haemodialysis, whereas the perfused vessel density of the SCP and DCP was unaffected. However, further studies are warranted to confirm the mechanism underlying the changes in the choriocapillaris perfused vessel density and the CT after haemodialysis.\\n\\nOur study demonstrated that evaluation of the vessel density in the choroidal layer using SS-OCTA may serve as a window to assess the systemic perfusion status. In the future, with further studies on the relationship among the retinal, choroidal, and systemic blood vessels, OCTA may become an effective non-invasive tool with which to identify the macular changes associated with systemic vascular diseases.', 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Optical coherence tomography angiography analysis of changes in the retina and the choroid after haemodialysis', 'journal_title': 'Scientific Reports'}\n",

Norbin is also an important endogenous modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling, and nervous system-specific homozygous gene disruptions, result in epileptic seizures. In this study, we aimed to investigate norbin expression patterns in epilepsy and to elucidate the relationships between norbin and mGluR5 and p-CaMKII in epilepsy. Double-immunolabeling, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting studies showed that norbin was downregulated in the temporal neocortex of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) compared with control subjects. Moreover, in a rat model of lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy, norbin expression began to decrease at 6&#x02009;h after the onset of status epilepticus and remained at a low level until 60 days. In addition, p-CaMKII expression was significantly increased in both patients with TLE and in animal model. Norbin and mGluR5 were found to be co-expressed in neurons of epileptic tissues. Finally, norbin over-expression facilitated by injections of adeno-associated viral vector into the rat hippocampus increased latency and survival in the lithium chloride-pilocarpine model. Thus, our results indicate norbin participates in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, perhaps by modulating mGluR5 signaling, regulating CaMKII phosphorylation, and may exert antiepileptic effects.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id=\"Sec1\" sec-type=\"introduction\"><title>Introduction</title><p id=\"Par2\">Norbin, identified in 1997, is a cytoplasmic protein weighing approximately 78 KDa that is widely distributed in neuronal tissues.

In our study, p-CaMKII expression was significantly up regulated in the neurons of patients with TLE. In lithium chloride-pilocarpine-treated rats, p-CaMKII expression decreased temporarily and then increased in chronic period. p-CaMKII was reduced in hippocampus of rats after AAV-Norbin vector injection.

In this study, our results showed that norbin and p-CaMKII levels were negative correlation in hippocampus and cortex of control rats and epileptic rats at chronic periods (such as 1 month and 2 month), especially in hippocampus homogenate. However, the negative correlation is not well between norbin and p-CaMKII levels in hippocampus and cortex of epileptic rats at acute period. It is difficult to explain the phenomena, the possible reason maybe the protein changed later than DNA or mRNA changed in acute period or has other mechanisms.</p><p id=\"Par25\">Finally, we investigated the effects of norbin over-expression by injecting AAV vectors into the hippocampus of lithium chloride-pilocarpine model rats. Over-expression of norbin influences the expression of p-CaMKII, which reduced the expression of p-CaMKII in hippocampus of rats. We found that intra-hippocampal injections of AAV-norbin result in long-lasting protein over-expression in neurons, which influences seizure activity and protects rats during the acute epileptic period. Norbin over-expression also increased latency and survival in lithium chloride-pilocarpine model rats and prolonged latency in epilepsy, suggesting that norbin expression has antiepileptic effects.</p><p id=\"Par26\">We demonstrated for the first time that norbin is downregulated in the neurons of epileptic rat brains and patients with TLE. However, our study was not without limitations. First, only a select group of patients with TLE can be treated via surgical removal of their epileptogenic tissue. These pharmaco-resistant patients suffer from frequent seizures for many years and may not be representative of most patients with epilepsy. Second, we noted no significant difference in age between patients with TLE and control subjects; however, the TLE group included more adolescents than the control group. Structural and functional differences between adolescents and adults may contribute to the development of epilepsy in the former group. This phenomenon requires further study. Moreover, in our animal study, we used a lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. Pre-treatment of atropine will prevent chloride-pilocarpine-induced seizures<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref></sup>. The effects of norbin over-expression on epileptic behavior may be different in different epileptic models as a result of differences in the pathological changes induced by epilepsy in the models.

At the time of surgery, all the patients with TLE were refractory to maximal doses of three or more AEDs, including Carbamazepine, Clonazepam, Lamotrigine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Topiramate, and Valproate. All tissue blocks were obtained from patients who underwent therapeutic resections. After lesion resection, electrodes used for intraoperative electrocorticography were placed on the edges of the remaining tissue to ensure that the lesion had been completely resected.</p><p id=\"Par30\">Thirty-two human (fifteen females and seventeen males) brain samples were randomly selected from a bank of brain tissue samples taken from patients with intractable TLE whose ages ranged from 8 to 58 years.

Healthy adult male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;56; obtained from the Chongqing Medical University Laboratory Animal Center) weighing 250&#x02013;300&#x02009;g were randomly assigned to a normal control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) or an experimental group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;49). Approximately 18&#x02009;h thereafter, we treated the animals with atropine sulfate (1&#x02009;mg/kg, i.p.) to limit the peripheral effects of the convulsant. Thirty min later, we induced status epilepticus (SE) in 49 rats by injecting them with pilocarpine hydrochloride (30&#x02009;mg/kg, i.p., Sigma, USA). Pilocarpine hydrochloride was administered (10&#x02009;mg/kg, i.p.) every 30&#x02009;min until the rats developed seizures. The rats developed spontaneous recurrent seizures, which were scored according to Racine, at 6&#x02013;11 days after pilocarpine treatment<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref></sup>. Only rats that attained grade 4&#x02013;5 seizures were included in the study. Seven control rats were treated with lithium chloride and atropine sulfate but were subsequently treated with saline instead of pilocarpine. One hour after the onset of SE, we reduced the severity of the convulsions from which the rats were suffering with 10&#x02009;mg/kg diazepam i.p. The experimental group was randomly divided into 6-h, 24-h, 72-h, 7-day, 14-day, 30-day, and 60-day post-SE onset subgroups; thus, the rats in these groups were sacrificed at 6&#x02009;h, 24&#x02009;h, 72&#x02009;h, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, or 60 days after SE onset, after which the hippocampus and adjacent cortex were removed for study.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec13\"><title>Tissue processing</title><p id=\"Par34\">In both the human and animal experiments, one portion of resected brain tissue was immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 48&#x02009;h. The tissue specimens were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 &#x003bc;m for the immunohistochemistry experiments and a thickness of 10 &#x003bc;m for the double-immunofluorescence labeling analysis. The other portions of resected brain tissue were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen and later used for protein extraction (see the western blotting protocol). The animals were subsequently perfused transcardially with physiological saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1&#x02009;M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4), under chloral hydrate anesthesia (0.35&#x02009;g/kg, i.p.). The brains were removed and postfixed in the same fixative for 1&#x02009;h. Thereafter, the entire hippocampus and adjacent cortex were frozen and sectioned at a thickness of 10 &#x003bc;m with a cryostat for double-immunofluorescence labeling analysis.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec14\"><title>Double-immunofluorescence labeling</title><p id=\"Par35\">The tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and then incubated in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.3%, 15&#x02009;min). The frozen sections were subsequently air-dried on a slide warmer at 50&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for at least half an hour. For antigen retrieval, the sections were treated with 10&#x02009;mmol/l sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heated in a microwave oven for 20&#x02009;min at 92&#x02013;98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The tissues were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, after which they were incubated in serum for 1&#x02009;h at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with a mixture of primary antibodies overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p><p id=\"Par36\">The sections were subsequently incubated with the following antibodies: anti-norbin antibody (Abcam, USA), rabbit anti-MAP2 antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), polyclonal goat anti-norbin antibody (Abcam, USA), rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), polyclonal goat anti-norbin antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), rabbit anti-mGluR5 antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), rabbit anti-p-CaMKII antibody (phosphor T286) (Abcam, USA), mouse anti-GFAP antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), rabbit anti-p-CaMKII antibody (phosphor T286) (Abcam, USA), mouse anti-MAP2 antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), mouse anti-Flag antibody, rabbit anti-MAP2 antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), mouse anti-Flag antibody and rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (Santa Cruz, USA). The sections were then washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, i.e., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated IgG (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Inc. Beijing, China) or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated IgG (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Inc. Beijing, China), in the dark for 60&#x02009;min at room temperature. For propidium iodide (PI) staining, the slides were incubated in 2% PI in the dark for 7&#x02009;min. After being rinsed thrice for 1&#x02009;min each in distilled water, the slides were dried and coverslipped with 50% glycerol/PBS. Fluorescence was detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Germany), which was performed with an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with a Fluoview FVX confocal scanhead.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec15\"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p id=\"Par37\">Immunohistochemical staining was conducted using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method, according to established protocols or the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The primary antibody used in the experiment was mouse anti-norbin, and the secondary antibody used in the experiment was included with the indicated kit (Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Wuhan, China). The negative controls were incubated with PBS rather than the indicated primary antibody. The images of each section were scanned and acquired by an OLYMPUS PM20 automatic microscope (Olympus, Japan) and a TCFY-2050 (Yuancheng Inc., China) pathology system. Five random visual fields in each section were imaged (5 sections in each brain). The immunohistochemical results were assessed by automatically measuring the average integrated optical density (IOD) to determine the IOD-to-field area ratio using a Motic Med 6.0 CMIAS pathology image analysis system (Beihang Motic Inc., China)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref></sup>. The mean of the values from 5 fields in each slide image was subsequently calculated and used to determine the differences in the immunohistochemistry results between the epilepsy and control groups.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec16\"><title>Western blotting</title><p id=\"Par38\">Fifty micrograms of protein were separated by 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corporation, USA) for western blot analysis, which was performed with a Bio-Rad apparatus (Bio-Rad, USA). Non-specific epitopes were blocked with 5% skim milk/Tween-20-Tris-buffered saline (TTBS), after which the membranes were incubated with each of the following primary antibodies overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C: mouse anti-norbin antibody (1:500, Abcam, USA), rabbit anti-p-CaMKII antibody (1:1000), rabbit anti-&#x003b2;-actin as control antibody (1:5000, Beijing 4A Biotech Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) and mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (1:4000). After being washed thrice in TBST, the membranes were treated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1&#x02009;h at room temperature before being visualized in a darkroom with an ECM kit (Pierce, USA) and a CCD camera (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The digitally scanned immunoblots were subsequently analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The band intensities for norbin and p-CaMKII, which were represented by the ODs of norbin and p-CaMKII blot expression, were normalized to those of &#x003b2;-actin or GAPDH after electrophoresis<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec17\"><title>Norbin over-expression by AAV vector injection</title><p id=\"Par39\">The AAV vectors used herein were derived from a mixture of adenoviral serotypes 2 and 8. One of the vectors included the full-length cDNA sequence encoding rat norbin (stock solutions: AAV- Norbin, 1.26E&#x02009;+&#x02009;13 genomic particles/ml), and the other vector served as a control (AAV-empty: 6.72E&#x02009;+&#x02009;13 genomic particles/ml). The AAV-Norbin and AAV-empty vectors were generated, produced and purified by Neuron Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Briefly, the target gene was cloned into an AAFE001BpAOV.Syn. eGFP AAV production shuttle plasmid, with which AAV-293 cells were subsequently infected to produce AAV vectors, which were purified by double-CsCl ultracentrifugation and then buffer-exchanged with PD-10 desalting columns. The AAV titers were determined by quantitative real-time PCR, and the purity of the nucleic acid sequences contained therein was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Supplement 1 shows an AAV vector spectrum graph (supplement <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>), and supplement 2 (supplement <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>) shows the AAV vector sequence. Studies have shown that AAV-empty has no effect on seizure activity, nor does it have an effect on related neuropathology; thus, its effects, or lack thereof, were similar to those of saline or vectors carrying reporter genes (such as GFP)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id=\"Par40\">The rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of chloral hydrate (350&#x02009;mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and then placed in a stereotaxic frame (Woruide, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China), after which the AAV-vectors were injected using a 30-gauge needle.

The pipette was left in place for an additional 5&#x02009;min after the injection to prevent backflow of the viral particles through the injection track<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref></sup>. The viral vector stock solutions were diluted 1:10 with sterile phosphate-buffered saline before use.</p><p id=\"Par41\">After 2&#x02013;3 weeks, some of rats were sacrificed via the infusion of drugs into the left ventricle. eGFP expression was subsequently assessed in the AAV-control brain slice, and Flag expression was assessed in the AAV-Norbin brain slice by immunofluorescence. The other portions of resected brain tissue were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen and later used for protein extraction (see the western blotting protocol). At the same time point, the epileptic rat model was induced by lithium chloride-pilocarpine hydrochloride administration, after which kindling was performed, according to a previously described protocol. The initial pilocarpine hydrochloride dose was 30&#x02009;mg/kg. At 45&#x02009;minutes after the first dose, pilocarpine hydrochloride was administered at the indicated dose (10&#x02009;mg/kg, i.p.), which was re-administered every 15&#x02009;minutes thereafter until the rats developed seizures. Rats that did not experience grade 4&#x02013;5 seizures after 8 pilocarpine injections were classified as non-seizure rats. After 2&#x02009;h of SE, the seizure rats were given 10&#x02009;mg/kg diazepam i.p. to stop their seizures.

Norbin promotes neurite outgrowth1 and is a regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis2. Moreover, norbin expression enhances metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling in vitro expression systems, and the neuron-specific protein plays a critical role in mGluR5 localization3. Norbin is also a negative regulator of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (Thr-286) phosphorylation and is essential for spatial learning4. In addition, nervous system-specific homozygous gene disruptions, which interfere with norbin expression, result in epileptic seizures4.\\n\\nNorbin expression likely plays an important role in epilepsy; however, to our knowledge, no study has addressed the role of norbin in the brain tissues of patients with epilepsy or rat models. In this study, we investigated norbin expression in the temporal neocortex of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and also assessed p-CaMKII expression and mGluR5 signaling in the epileptic brain tissues of patients with epilepsy. To extend the results of the analyses of human tissues, we investigated norbin expression in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues of a rat model of TLE at different time points after the onset of epilepsy. In addition, we investigated p-CaMKII expression in both patients and the animal model and assessed mGluR5 and norbin co-expression after the onset of epilepsy. Moreover, we also observed the influence of norbin over-expression in the rat hippocampus in the lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced model of acute epilepsy.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nNorbin neuronal localization and deceased norbin protein expression in the temporal neocortex of patients with TLE\\n\\nThe norbin protein was found to be expressed in the membrane and cytoplasm of neurons in the temporal neocortical tissues of non-epileptic autopsy controls and patients with TLE. Strong norbin staining was observed in the corresponding sections from subjects in the non-epileptic group, whereas faint immunoreactivity for norbin was observed in the corresponding sections from patients in the TLE group (Fig.\\xa01A). No immunoreactivity was observed in the negative control group, in which the primary antibody had been omitted.\\n\\nFigure 1 Immunohistochemical, double-immunofluorescence labelling, and western blotting analyses of norbin expression in the temporal neocortex of patients with TLE (n\\u2009=\\u200932) or without TLE (n\\u2009=\\u200914). (A) Immunohistochemistry analysis of norbin expression in the human temporal neocortex. The arrowheads indicate norbin-positive cells. (Control) Strong norbin immunoreactivity in the temporal neocortex of a control subject. (TLE) Faint norbin immunoreactivity in the temporal neocortex of a patient with TLE. (Negative-control) Secondary antibody-only reactivity control. Insets show the representative morphology at a higher magnification. (B) Double-immunofluorescence labelling analysis shows that norbin (red) and MAP2 (green) are coexpressed (merged) in the temporal neocortex of patients with epilepsy. The arrowheads indicate norbin+/MAP2+ cells. (C) Western blotting analysis of norbin expression in the temporal neocortex of humans. (Left) Proteins from individual brain homogenates from patients with TLE and control subjects were separated by gradient SDS-PAGE. Immunoreactive staining for norbin was weaker in patients with TLE than in controls. (Right) Comparison of the mean OD value showing that norbin expression levels were significantly lower in patients with TLE than in controls (*p\\u2009<\\u20090.05).\\n\\nUsing double-immunofluorescence labeling, we found that norbin was expressed exclusively in neurons in the temporal neocortical tissues from non-epileptic control subjects and patients with TLE. Specifically, we found that norbin colocalized with the dendritic marker microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) (Fig.\\xa01B). No glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP+) astrocytes were stained (data not shown), indicating that norbin was not expressed in these cells.\\n\\nRegarding the western blotting results, norbin immunoreactivity bands were observed at approximately 75\\u2009kDa, and β-actin immunoreactivity bands were observed at approximately 42\\u2009kDa. We evaluated norbin expression in the temporal neocortex of all patients with TLE and all non-epileptic controls. The results confirmed that norbin is expressed at high levels in the temporal neocortex in patients without epilepsy and is expressed at low levels in this region in patients with TLE (Fig.\\xa01C). The temporal neocortex samples from patients with TLE showed fainter norbin immunoreactivity than the normal brain tissue samples from non-epileptic autopsy control subjects (Fig.\\xa01C). The mean optical density (OD) value for the norbin protein in the temporal neocortical tissues of patients with TLE was significantly lower than that in the corresponding tissues of non-epileptic autopsy control subjects (0.68\\u2009±\\u20090.21 vs. 1.29\\u2009±\\u20090.34, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) (Fig.\\xa01C).\\n\\n\\nNorbin expression is decreased in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues in epileptic rats\\n\\nTo exclude the possibility that alterations in norbin expression may be caused by AEDs in patients with epilepsy, we performed experiments involving a rat model of epilepsy. We found that norbin was expressed exclusively in neurons of the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues in control and epileptic rats. Specifically, we noted that norbin colocalized with the dendritic marker MAP2 (Fig.\\xa02A). GFAP+ astrocytes did not stain (data not shown), indicating that norbin was not expressed in these cells.\\n\\nFigure 2 Double-immunofluorescence labeling and western blotting analysis of norbin expression in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues of experimental rats (n\\u2009=\\u200956).

(Right) Comparison of the mean cortical immunoblotting OD value between control and epileptic rats at each time point after SE. *p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, epileptic rats at different time points vs. control.\\n\\nWe performed western blot analysis to verify the above changes in norbin immunostaining. We found that decreases in norbin expression in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues of epileptic rats began at 6\\u2009h post-status epilepticus (SE) onset and remained at a relatively low level until 60 days post-SE onset (Fig.\\xa02B,C). Semiquantitative densitometric analysis revealed that norbin expression in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues was significantly decreased at each time point in the corresponding group compared to the control group (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) (Fig.\\xa02B,C).\\n\\n\\np-CaMKII expression in epileptic brain\\n\\nUsing double-immunofluorescence labeling, we found that p-CaMKII was expressed exclusively in neurons in the temporal neocortical tissues of non-epileptic control subjects and patients with TLE. Specifically, we found that p-CaMKII colocalized with the dendritic marker MAP2 (Fig.\\xa03A). No GFAP+ astrocytes stained (data not shown), indicating that p-CaMKII was not expressed in these cells.\\n\\nFigure 3 Double-immunofluorescence labeling and Western blotting analyses of p-CaMKII expression in patients and in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues of experimental rats.

(Right) Comparison of the mean cortical immunoblotting OD value between control rats and epileptic rats at each time point after SE. *p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, epileptic rats at different time points vs. control.\\n\\nWe also found that p-CaMKII was expressed in neurons in epileptic rats. Specifically, we found that p-CaMKII colocalized with the dendritic marker MAP2 (data not shown). No GFAP+ astrocytes stained (Fig.\\xa03B), indicating that p-CaMKII was not expressed in these cells.\\n\\nNorbin is a negative regulator of p-CaMKII4, however, it is not clear the co-localization of p-CaMKII and norbin. We performed double staining immunofluorescence of both norbin and p-CaMKII to examine the localization of p-CaMKII and norbin in brain after epilepsy. Our studies showed that Norbin and p-CaMKII were co-expressed in single neuron (Fig.\\xa03C).\\n\\nWestern blotting showed that p-CaMKII expression was significantly increased in patients with epilepsy compared to control subjects (Fig.\\xa03D). p-CaMKII immunoreactive bands were observed at approximately 50–60\\u2009kDa, and GAPDH immunoreactive bands were observed at approximately 35\\u2009kDa. We evaluated p-CaMKII expression in the temporal neocortex of patients with TLE and non-epileptic controls. We found that the temporal neocortex samples from patients with TLE showed stronger p-CaMKII immunoreactivity than the normal brain tissue samples from non-epileptic autopsy controls (Fig.\\xa03D). The difference in mean OD between the TLE and non-epileptic control groups was statistically significant (0.95\\u2009±\\u20090.21 vs. 0.56\\u2009±\\u20090.07, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) (Fig.\\xa03D).\\n\\nWestern blot analysis was performed to evaluate p-CaMKII expression in the hippocampus and cortex of epileptic rats. p-CaMKII expression in the indicated hippocampus homogenate increased at 6\\u2009h post-SE onset (169.6%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01), decreased at 24\\u2009h and 72\\u2009h post-SE onset (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and then increased at 7 days post-SE onset and remaining elevated until 60 days post-SE onset (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) (Fig.\\xa03E). The differences in mean OD between the epileptic groups and non-epileptic control group were statistically significant (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) (Fig.\\xa03E). Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate p-CaMKII expression in the cortex of epileptic rats (Fig.\\xa03F). p-CaMKII expression in the indicated epileptic tissues began to decrease at 24\\u2009h post-SE onset (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and then increased at 72\\u2009h post-SE onset (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and remained elevated until 60 days post-SE onset (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) (Fig.\\xa03F).\\n\\n\\nCo-localization of norbin and mGluR5 in neurons of epileptic brain\\n\\nPrevious studies showed that norbin expression enhances mGluR5 signaling in vitro, norbin and mGluR5 are co-localization3. To examine localizations of mGluR5 and norbin in hippocampus and cortex after epilepsy, we used double staining immunofluorescence of mGluR5 and norbin in epileptic brain slice. Our studies found that mGluR5 and norbin were co-expressed in the neurons of temporal neocortical tissues from non-epileptic control subjects and patients with TLE. As shown in the indicated figure, mGluR5 colocalized with norbin (Fig.\\xa04A). Our results also indicated that mGluR5 and norbin were co-expressed in the neurons of the rat hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues (Fig.\\xa04B).\\n\\nFigure 4 Double-immunofluorescence labelling for norbin and mGluR5 in the temporal neocortex of patients with TLE and in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues of experimental rats. The arrowheads indicate norbin+/mGluR5+ cells. Insets show the representative morphology at a higher magnification. (A) Norbin (green) and mGluR5 (red) are coexpressed (merged) in the temporal neocortex of patients with epilepsy. (B) Norbin (green) and mGluR5 (red) are coexpressed (merged) in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues of TLE rats.\\n\\n\\nAdeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors in epilepsy\\n\\nAt 3 days after vector injection, we observed\\xa0enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression via fluorescence microscopy. We found that eGFP was expressed in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues and that its expression was stronger at 14 days after injection than at 3 days after injection (Fig.\\xa05A,C). eGFP and the nuclear marker propidium iodide (PI) were expressed at the same location (Fig.\\xa05A,B). Flag was expressed in the rat hippocampus and adjacent cortical tissues (Fig.\\xa06A,B). Moreover, Flag was expressed exclusively in neurons and colocalized with the dendritic marker MAP2 (data not shown). No GFAP+ astrocytes were stained (Fig.\\xa06B), indicating that Flag was not expressed in these cells.\\n\\nFigure 5 eGFP expression was assessed in the AAV-control brain slice by immunofluorescence and PI staining.

(Right) Comparison of the mean hippocampal immunoblotting OD value between AAV-Norbin group and AAV-empty group (*p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, AAV-Norbin group vs. AAV-empty group).\\n\\nWe examined the expression of p-CaMKII in the hippocampus of rats at 14 days after injection. The expression of p-CaMKII was down regulation in the AAV-Norbin group than in the AAV-empty (control) group (Fig.\\xa06C). Western blotting showed that p-CaMKII expression was significantly decreased in AAV-Norbin group compared to AAV-empty (control) group (Fig.\\xa06C). We found that the hippocampus of rats after AAV-Norbin vector injection showed fainter p-CaMKII immunoreactivity than the hippocampus samples from rats after AAV-empty vector injection (Fig.\\xa06C). The difference in mean OD between the AAV-Norbin and AAV-empty groups was statistically significant (1.10\\u2009±\\u20090.22 vs. 0.79\\u2009±\\u20090.19, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) (Fig.\\xa06C).\\n\\n\\nEpileptic behavior\\n\\nIn the AAV-Norbin group, 13 out of 16 (81.25%) rats displayed grade 4–5 seizure activity (81.25% of AAV-Norbin injected rats, n\\u2009=\\u200916). In the AAV-empty group, 9 out of 11 (81.82%) rats displayed grade 4–5 seizure activity (81.82% of AAV-empty injected rats, n\\u2009=\\u200911). In the saline group, 7 out of 7 (100%) rats displayed grade 4–5 seizure activity (n\\u2009=\\u20097). There was no significant difference in the percentage of rats that displayed grade 4–5 seizure activity among the three groups (Fig.\\xa07A). Latency (min) was defined as the period between pilocarpine injection and the first grade 4–5 seizure. The AAV-Norbin group had a longer latency than the other groups (107.5\\u2009±\\u200935.7 vs. 62.0\\u2009±\\u200939.3, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, 107\\u2009±\\u200935.7 vs. 63.1\\u2009±\\u200934.1, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) (Fig.\\xa07B). There was no difference in latency between the AAV-empty and NS groups. Comparison of\\xa0the hydrochloride pilocarpine dose required to induce grade 4–5 seizures, the AAV-norbin group required more hydrochloride pilocarpine than the other groups (73.8\\u2009±\\u200922.6 vs. 51.4\\u2009±\\u200923.4, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, 73.8\\u2009±\\u200922.6 vs.50.0\\u2009±\\u200918.7, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) (Fig.\\xa07C).

There was no difference in the number of injections required to induce seizures between the AAV-empty and NS groups (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05).\\n\\nWe noted a significant difference among the three groups with respect to the percentage of rats that experienced grade 4–5 seizures after receiving the indicated dose of pilocarpine (30\\u2009mg/kg). However, we noted no significant difference among the three groups with respect to the percentage of rats that experienced grade 4–5 seizures in response to higher doses of pilocarpine (Fig.\\xa07E).\\n\\nRegarding survival among the rats that experienced grade 4–5 seizures within 72\\u2009h after pilocarpine administration, more rats in the AAV-Norbin group (10 out of 13 rats (76.92%) than in the other groups survived the acute epileptic period (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Three out of 7 rats (42.86%) in NS group and 3 out of 9 rats (33.33%) in AAV-empty group survived the acute epileptic period. There was no difference in survival between the AAV-empty and NS groups (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05) (Fig.\\xa07F).\\n\\nOur studies showed basal p-CaMKII was reduced in hippocampus of rats after AAV-Norbin overexpression (Fig.\\xa06C). Furthermore, to show if AAV-Norbin overexpression blocks elevated p-CaMKII after pilocarpine hydrochloride induced seizures, we compared the p-CaMKII levels in the hippocampus homogenates of rats after pilocarpine hydrochloride induced seizures between AAV-Norbin group and AAV-empty group by Western bolt analysis. We analyzed the chronic periods of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy for mimics the epileptic state of patients. Our results showed that the p-CaMKII levels were increased at 14\\u2009day and at 1 month after pilocarpine-induced epilepsy both in AAV-Norbin group and AAV-empty group (Fig.\\xa07G, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). However, the p-CaMKII levels in AAV-Norbin group were lower than in AAV-empty group both in non-pilocarpine treated rats and in pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats (Fig.\\xa07G, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The differences in mean OD between the AAV-Norbin and AAV-empty groups were statistically significant (14 d: 1.12\\u2009±\\u20090.12 vs. 1.37\\u2009±\\u20090.11, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, 30 d: 0.99\\u2009±\\u20090.05 vs. 1.34\\u2009±\\u20090.10, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) (Fig.\\xa07G).\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe major findings of this study were as follows: (i) norbin expression is significantly downregulated in the neurons of patients with TLE and lithium chloride-pilocarpine-treated rats, (ii) p-CaMKII expression is significantly upregulated in the neurons of patients with TLE and lithium chloride-pilocarpine-treated rats, (iii) norbin and mGluR5 were co-expressed in the neurons of patients with TLE and lithium chloride-pilocarpine-treated rats and (iv) norbin over-expression in the rat hippocampus results p-CaMKII down regulation, and influences epileptic behavior in lithium chloride-pilocarpine-treated rats.\\n\\nNorbin modulates mGluR5 signaling1. mGluR5 responds mainly to the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate, which localizes at presynaptic sites and plays important roles in normal brain function and several pathological disorders, including epilepsy. Although the mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis remain unknown, previous studies have shown that mGluR5 is involved in epileptogenesis5. Accumulating evidence indicate that that mGluR5 protein interactions play an important role in regulating mGluR5 trafficking, internalization and signaling3. mGluR5 availability is reduced in the brain after the onset of pilocarpine-induced SE5,6. In the present study, norbin expression was downregulated in patients and the animal model, and norbin and mGluR5 were co-expressed in the neurons of patients with TLE and lithium chloride-pilocarpine-treated rats. Epilepsy is caused by alterations in mGluR5-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission. Decreases in the expression of norbin, which modulates mGluR5 signaling, may associated with the onset of epilepsy1,3,7,8. However, the exact role of norbin in the epilepsy phenotype remains unclear.\\n\\nNorbin is a negative regulator of CaMKII (Thr-286) phosphorylation4. In our study, p-CaMKII expression was significantly up regulated in the neurons of patients with TLE. In lithium chloride-pilocarpine-treated rats, p-CaMKII expression decreased temporarily and then increased in chronic period. p-CaMKII was reduced in hippocampus of rats after AAV-Norbin vector injection. Over-expression of norbin results down regulation of p-CaMKII, which accord with norbin as a negative regulator p-CaMKII4. CaMKII is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase in neurons that is involved in regulating neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in response to neuronal activity-induced calcium signaling9. CaMKII-mediated modulation of neuronal sodium current has effect on neuronal excitability in epilepsy10, and its inactivation is associated with many experimental models of epilepsy11,12. CaKMII activity at synapses is associated with epileptogenesis, as well as other changes in the synapse that are related to glutamate receptor activation13. CaMKII is significantly upregulated in the hippocampi of patients with TLE14, pThr286-CaMKII was localized to the dentate granule cells bodies, which is similar immunohistochemistry labeling intensities in all TLE and control specimens14. However, other studies showed that expressions of CaMKII and p-CaMKII were not affected by convulsive status epilepticus in lithium chloride-pilocarpine-treated rats of 15-day-old and 35-day-old15, sodium valproate treatment in vivo, inhibited expression and phosphorylation of CaMKII15. CaMKII activity decreases in the immediate period (24\\u2009h) following seizure onset, a change that likely plays an important role in the development of recurrent seizure activity13,16. CaMKIIa mRNA expression also decreases following seizures; however, after CaMKII mRNA expression levels return to normal (36–48\\u2009h), corresponding increases in CaMKII protein expression levels also occur13. In this study, our results showed that norbin and p-CaMKII levels were negative correlation in hippocampus and cortex of control rats and epileptic rats at chronic periods (such as 1 month and 2 month), especially in hippocampus homogenate. However, the negative correlation is not well between norbin and p-CaMKII levels in hippocampus and cortex of epileptic rats at acute period. It is difficult to explain the phenomena, the possible reason maybe the protein changed later than DNA or mRNA changed in acute period or has other mechanisms.\\n\\nFinally, we investigated the effects of norbin over-expression by injecting AAV vectors into the hippocampus of lithium chloride-pilocarpine model rats. Over-expression of norbin influences the expression of p-CaMKII, which reduced the expression of p-CaMKII in hippocampus of rats. We found that intra-hippocampal injections of AAV-norbin result in long-lasting protein over-expression in neurons, which influences seizure activity and protects rats during the acute epileptic period. Norbin over-expression also increased latency and survival in lithium chloride-pilocarpine model rats and prolonged latency in epilepsy, suggesting that norbin expression has antiepileptic effects.\\n\\nWe demonstrated for the first time that norbin is downregulated in the neurons of epileptic rat brains and patients with TLE. However, our study was not without limitations. First, only a select group of patients with TLE can be treated via surgical removal of their epileptogenic tissue. These pharmaco-resistant patients suffer from frequent seizures for many years and may not be representative of most patients with epilepsy. Second, we noted no significant difference in age between patients with TLE and control subjects; however, the TLE group included more adolescents than the control group. Structural and functional differences between adolescents and adults may contribute to the development of epilepsy in the former group. This phenomenon requires further study. Moreover, in our animal study, we used a lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. Pre-treatment of atropine will prevent chloride-pilocarpine-induced seizures17. The effects of norbin over-expression on epileptic behavior may be different in different epileptic models as a result of differences in the pathological changes induced by epilepsy in the models. Therefore, experiments with better designs are needed to study the effects of norbin over-expression on epilepsy in the future.\\n\\n\\nExperimental Procedures\\n\\n\\nHuman brain tissue and clinical data\\n\\nOur study protocol complied with the Guidelines for the Performance of Research Involving Human Subjects established by the National Institutes of Health and the Committee on Human Research at Chongqing Medical University. The study was approved by the Committee on Human Research of Chongqing Medical University.\\n\\nThirty-two patients undergoing surgery for medically intractable TLE and fourteen non-epilepsy control subjects were included in this study. All brain tissue specimens were randomly selected from our epilepsy brain tissue bank, which was described in our previous studies18–20. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or their legal guardians. All procedures were approved by the ethics committees of the appropriate institutions, and were conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.\\n\\nEach patient underwent a presurgical assessment comprising a detailed history and neurological examination, interictal and ictal electroencephalographic studies, neuropsychological testing, and neuroradiological studies. At the time of surgery, all the patients with TLE were refractory to maximal doses of three or more AEDs, including Carbamazepine, Clonazepam, Lamotrigine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Topiramate, and Valproate. All tissue blocks were obtained from patients who underwent therapeutic resections. After lesion resection, electrodes used for intraoperative electrocorticography were placed on the edges of the remaining tissue to ensure that the lesion had been completely resected.\\n\\nThirty-two human (fifteen females and seventeen males) brain samples were randomly selected from a bank of brain tissue samples taken from patients with intractable TLE whose ages ranged from 8 to 58 years. The mean age of the population was 24.4\\u2009±\\u200912.2 years. Table\\xa01 summarizes the clinical features of these patients.\\n\\nTable 1\\nClinical variable\\tTLE n\\u2009=\\u200932\\tControl n\\u2009=\\u200914\\tP-value\\nAge (years) (range)\\t24.4\\u2009±\\u200912.2 (8–58)\\t25.8\\u2009±\\u200911.5 (15–50)\\t0.609\\nEpilepsy onset (years) (range)\\t13.3\\u2009±\\u20099.7 (1–38)\\tNA\\nEpilepsy duration (years) (range)\\t10.8\\u2009±\\u20097.4 (1–29)\\tNA\\nSeizure frequency (no./month) (range)\\t9.9\\u2009±\\u20096.7 (3–30)\\tNA\\nSeizure type (n)\\tCPS (9) SGS (17) CPS and SGS (6)\\tNA\\nMale/female\\t17/15\\t8/6\\t0.529\\n\\nFor comparison purposes, we obtained fourteen histologically normal temporal neocortex samples from individuals who were treated for increased intracranial pressure caused by head trauma from a traffic accident and later died from their injuries. Control brain samples were collected only in cases in which the brain was acutely exposed to the environment outside the skull as a result of a severe head injury, the patient was deemed unrevivable, or the patient had died. Conventional neuropathologic examinations revealed no signs of central nervous system disease in the brain tissues of the control group, whose mean age was 25.8\\u2009±\\u200911.5 years (range, 15–50 years). The control subjects had no history of epilepsy or exposure to AEDs. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or tissue topography between the TLE and control tissue samples.\\n\\n\\nRat model of epilepsy\\n\\nAll animal procedures were conducted in accordance with international standards and were approved by the Commission for Ethical Experimentation on Animals of Chongqing Medical University.\\n\\nThe rat model was established as reported previously19,20. Healthy adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (n\\u2009=\\u200956; obtained from the Chongqing Medical University Laboratory Animal Center) weighing 250–300\\u2009g were randomly assigned to a normal control group (n\\u2009=\\u20097) or an experimental group (n\\u2009=\\u200949). Approximately 18\\u2009h thereafter, we treated the animals with atropine sulfate (1\\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) to limit the peripheral effects of the convulsant. Thirty min later, we induced status epilepticus (SE) in 49 rats by injecting them with pilocarpine hydrochloride (30\\u2009mg/kg, i.p., Sigma, USA). Pilocarpine hydrochloride was administered (10\\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) every 30\\u2009min until the rats developed seizures. The rats developed spontaneous recurrent seizures, which were scored according to Racine, at 6–11 days after pilocarpine treatment21. Only rats that attained grade 4–5 seizures were included in the study. Seven control rats were treated with lithium chloride and atropine sulfate but were subsequently treated with saline instead of pilocarpine. One hour after the onset of SE, we reduced the severity of the convulsions from which the rats were suffering with 10\\u2009mg/kg diazepam i.p. The experimental group was randomly divided into 6-h, 24-h, 72-h, 7-day, 14-day, 30-day, and 60-day post-SE onset subgroups; thus, the rats in these groups were sacrificed at 6\\u2009h, 24\\u2009h, 72\\u2009h, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, or 60 days after SE onset, after which the hippocampus and adjacent cortex were removed for study.\\n\\n\\nTissue processing\\n\\nIn both the human and animal experiments, one portion of resected brain tissue was immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 48\\u2009h. The tissue specimens were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm for the immunohistochemistry experiments and a thickness of 10 μm for the double-immunofluorescence labeling analysis. The other portions of resected brain tissue were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen and later used for protein extraction (see the western blotting protocol). The animals were subsequently perfused transcardially with physiological saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\\u2009M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4), under chloral hydrate anesthesia (0.35\\u2009g/kg, i.p.). The brains were removed and postfixed in the same fixative for 1\\u2009h. Thereafter, the entire hippocampus and adjacent cortex were frozen and sectioned at a thickness of 10 μm with a cryostat for double-immunofluorescence labeling analysis.\\n\\n\\nDouble-immunofluorescence labeling\\n\\nThe tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and then incubated in H2O2 (0.3%, 15\\u2009min). The frozen sections were subsequently air-dried on a slide warmer at 50\\u2009°C for at least half an hour. For antigen retrieval, the sections were treated with 10\\u2009mmol/l sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heated in a microwave oven for 20\\u2009min at 92–98\\u2009°C. The tissues were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, after which they were incubated in serum for 1\\u2009h at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with a mixture of primary antibodies overnight at 4\\u2009°C.\\n\\nThe sections were subsequently incubated with the following antibodies: anti-norbin antibody (Abcam, USA), rabbit anti-MAP2 antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), polyclonal goat anti-norbin antibody (Abcam, USA), rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), polyclonal goat anti-norbin antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), rabbit anti-mGluR5 antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), rabbit anti-p-CaMKII antibody (phosphor T286) (Abcam, USA), mouse anti-GFAP antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), rabbit anti-p-CaMKII antibody (phosphor T286) (Abcam, USA), mouse anti-MAP2 antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), mouse anti-Flag antibody, rabbit anti-MAP2 antibody (Santa Cruz, USA), mouse anti-Flag antibody and rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (Santa Cruz, USA). The sections were then washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, i.e., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated IgG (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Inc. Beijing, China) or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated IgG (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Inc. Beijing, China), in the dark for 60\\u2009min at room temperature. For propidium iodide (PI) staining, the slides were incubated in 2% PI in the dark for 7\\u2009min. After being rinsed thrice for 1\\u2009min each in distilled water, the slides were dried and coverslipped with 50% glycerol/PBS. Fluorescence was detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Germany), which was performed with an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with a Fluoview FVX confocal scanhead.\\n\\n\\nImmunohistochemistry\\n\\nImmunohistochemical staining was conducted using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method, according to established protocols or the manufacturer’s instructions. The primary antibody used in the experiment was mouse anti-norbin, and the secondary antibody used in the experiment was included with the indicated kit (Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Wuhan, China). The negative controls were incubated with PBS rather than the indicated primary antibody. The images of each section were scanned and acquired by an OLYMPUS PM20 automatic microscope (Olympus, Japan) and a TCFY-2050 (Yuancheng Inc., China) pathology system. Five random visual fields in each section were imaged (5 sections in each brain). The immunohistochemical results were assessed by automatically measuring the average integrated optical density (IOD) to determine the IOD-to-field area ratio using a Motic Med 6.0 CMIAS pathology image analysis system (Beihang Motic Inc., China)19. The mean of the values from 5 fields in each slide image was subsequently calculated and used to determine the differences in the immunohistochemistry results between the epilepsy and control groups.\\n\\n\\nWestern blotting\\n\\nFifty micrograms of protein were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corporation, USA) for western blot analysis, which was performed with a Bio-Rad apparatus (Bio-Rad, USA). Non-specific epitopes were blocked with 5% skim milk/Tween-20-Tris-buffered saline (TTBS), after which the membranes were incubated with each of the following primary antibodies overnight at 4\\u2009°C: mouse anti-norbin antibody (1:500, Abcam, USA), rabbit anti-p-CaMKII antibody (1:1000), rabbit anti-β-actin as control antibody (1:5000, Beijing 4A Biotech Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) and mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (1:4000). After being washed thrice in TBST, the membranes were treated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1\\u2009h at room temperature before being visualized in a darkroom with an ECM kit (Pierce, USA) and a CCD camera (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The digitally scanned immunoblots were subsequently analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The band intensities for norbin and p-CaMKII, which were represented by the ODs of norbin and p-CaMKII blot expression, were normalized to those of β-actin or GAPDH after electrophoresis22.\\n\\n\\nNorbin over-expression by AAV vector injection\\n\\nThe AAV vectors used herein were derived from a mixture of adenoviral serotypes 2 and 8. One of the vectors included the full-length cDNA sequence encoding rat norbin (stock solutions: AAV- Norbin, 1.26E\\u2009+\\u200913 genomic particles/ml), and the other vector served as a control (AAV-empty: 6.72E\\u2009+\\u200913 genomic particles/ml). The AAV-Norbin and AAV-empty vectors were generated, produced and purified by Neuron Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Briefly, the target gene was cloned into an AAFE001BpAOV.Syn. eGFP AAV production shuttle plasmid, with which AAV-293 cells were subsequently infected to produce AAV vectors, which were purified by double-CsCl ultracentrifugation and then buffer-exchanged with PD-10 desalting columns. The AAV titers were determined by quantitative real-time PCR, and the purity of the nucleic acid sequences contained therein was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Supplement 1 shows an AAV vector spectrum graph (supplement 1), and supplement 2 (supplement 2) shows the AAV vector sequence. Studies have shown that AAV-empty has no effect on seizure activity, nor does it have an effect on related neuropathology; thus, its effects, or lack thereof, were similar to those of saline or vectors carrying reporter genes (such as GFP)23–25.\\n\\nThe rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of chloral hydrate (350\\u2009mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and then placed in a stereotaxic frame (Woruide, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China), after which the AAV-vectors were injected using a 30-gauge needle. Two microliters of viral vector suspension and 1\\u2009µl of a mannitol mixture were infused into the dorsal (anterior–posterior, −3.3 mm; medial–lateral, 1.8 mm; dorsal–ventral, −2.6 mm) and ventral hippocampi bilaterally (anterior–posterior, −4.8 mm; medial–lateral, 5.2 mm; dorsal–ventral, −6.4 mm; and −3.8 mm; 0.75\\u2009µl at each location in the dorsal–ventral plane)23,26,27. The bregma was the reference point for the anterior–posterior axis, the midline was reference point for the medial–lateral axis, and the dura was the reference point for the dorsal–ventral axis. The pipette was left in place for an additional 5\\u2009min after the injection to prevent backflow of the viral particles through the injection track26. The viral vector stock solutions were diluted 1:10 with sterile phosphate-buffered saline before use.\\n\\nAfter 2–3 weeks, some of rats were sacrificed via the infusion of drugs into the left ventricle. eGFP expression was subsequently assessed in the AAV-control brain slice, and Flag expression was assessed in the AAV-Norbin brain slice by immunofluorescence. The other portions of resected brain tissue were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen and later used for protein extraction (see the western blotting protocol). At the same time point, the epileptic rat model was induced by lithium chloride-pilocarpine hydrochloride administration, after which kindling was performed, according to a previously described protocol. The initial pilocarpine hydrochloride dose was 30\\u2009mg/kg. At 45\\u2009minutes after the first dose, pilocarpine hydrochloride was administered at the indicated dose (10\\u2009mg/kg, i.p.), which was re-administered every 15\\u2009minutes thereafter until the rats developed seizures. Rats that did not experience grade 4–5 seizures after 8 pilocarpine injections were classified as non-seizure rats. After 2\\u2009h of SE, the seizure rats were given 10\\u2009mg/kg diazepam i.p. to stop their seizures.

We apply Kriging interpolation to four months of data to derive pollution maps for eastern China. Consistent with prior findings, the greatest pollution occurs in the east, but significant levels are widespread across northern and central China and are not limited to major cities or geologic basins. Sources of pollution are widespread, but are particularly intense in a northeast corridor that extends from near Shanghai to north of Beijing. During our analysis period, 92% of the population of China experienced &#x0003e;120 hours of unhealthy air (US EPA standard), and 38% experienced average concentrations that were unhealthy. China&#x02019;s population-weighted average exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> was 52 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>. The observed air pollution is calculated to contribute to 1.6 million deaths/year in China [0.7&#x02013;2.2 million deaths/year at 95% confidence], roughly 17% of all deaths in China.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received support from Berkeley Earth, a 501c3 non-profit, whose website is <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.berkeleyearth.org\">http://www.berkeleyearth.org</ext-link>.

Particulate sources include electric power plants, industrial facilities, automobiles, biomass burning, and fossil fuels used in homes and factories for heating. In China, air pollution was previously estimated to contribute to 1.2 to 2 million deaths annually [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref002\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref004\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>].</p><p>In 2012, China adopted the Ambient Air Quality Standard [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref009\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>], and began development of a national Air Reporting System that now includes 945 sites in 190 cities. These automated stations report hourly via the internet, and focus on six pollutants: particulate matter &#x0003c; 2.5 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter &#x0003c; 10 microns (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO). Provincial governments perform air quality monitoring at 600 additional locations that are not yet integrated into the national system. Previous studies of regional scale air pollution have generally relied on satellite data [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref010\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref011\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>] or modeling [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref012\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>,<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref013\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>], but the high density of hourly data in China now allows regional patterns to be constructed directly from ground observations.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\" id=\"sec002\"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Though China deserves praise for its monitoring system and transparent communication, most archived observations are not publicly available. To compensate, real-time data was downloaded every hour during a four month interval from April 5, 2014 to August 5, 2014. Due to download restrictions on the official Chinese air quality reporting system, two different third-party sources were used: <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://PM25.in\">PM25.in</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://AQICN.org\">AQICN.org</ext-link>. <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://PM25.in\">PM25.in</ext-link> is a direct mirror of data from the 945 stations in China&#x02019;s national network, while <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://AQICN.org\">AQICN.org</ext-link> is the world&#x02019;s largest aggregator of real-time air quality data and included many additional sites in China and surrounding areas. Nearly all of the additional data from within China originates from stations operated by provincial environmental agencies that have not yet been incorporated in China&#x02019;s national network.</p><p>Consistency, quality control, and validation checks were applied to the raw data prior to further analysis in order to reduce the impact of outliers, badly calibrated instruments, and other problems. The most common quality problem was associated with stuck instruments that implausibly reported the same concentration continuously for many hours. A regional consistency check was also applied to verify that each station was reporting data similar to its neighboring stations. Approximately 8% of the data was removed as a result of the quality control review. Further details are described in the supplemental material (<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.s001\" ref-type=\"supplementary-material\">S1 Text</xref>).</p><p>As little monitoring is conducted in western China (<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.g001\" ref-type=\"fig\">Fig 1</xref>); we will focus on China east of 95&#x000b0; E, which includes 97% of the population. After removing stations with a high percentage of missing values or with other quality control problems, this study used 880 national network sites, 640 other sites in China and Taiwan, and 236 sites in other countries within 500 km of China (mostly South Korea).

Nitrogen oxides, including nitric oxide (NO) and NO<sub>2</sub> are created when air is heated, and on average have been attributed to transportation fuels (15&#x02013;25%), fossil fuel burning in power plants (30&#x02013;50%), and to industrial facilities (25&#x02013;35%) [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref023\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref024\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>]. It is expected that NO dominates at the combustion source, but in the presence of sunlight NO and NO<sub>2</sub> will equilibrate within a few minutes (as well as reacting with O<sub>3</sub>), implying that NO<sub>2</sub> measurements reflect a combination of NO and NO<sub>2</sub> emissions. SO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been previously associated with coal (~90%) in power plants and industrial facilities [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref025\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>]. Beijing has negligible SO<sub>2</sub> flux, despite a large NO<sub>2</sub> signal, possibly a result of policies that limit coal burning in the immediate vicinity of Beijing and more extensively apply mitigation technologies.</p><p>Many of the SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> sources are also sources of PM pollution. This is not surprising since fossil fuel burning is also a major source of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>. However, the PM sources appear more diffuse than either the SO<sub>2</sub> or NO<sub>2</sub> sources. In part, this is caused by secondary particulate matter formed within the atmosphere from other pollutants, such as SO<sub>2</sub> or NO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref026\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>]. Secondary particulate formation may cause PM fluxes to appear more widely distributed than the underlying emitters. Nonetheless, many strong PM sources are identified through this analysis. Within the study region, 10% of the area is responsible for 34% of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions, and 5% of the area is responsible for 22% of emissions. However, small and moderate sources are also important. Approximately 37% of the study region had PM<sub>2.5</sub> fluxes &#x0003e;0.5 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>/hr, sufficient to exceed US EPA standards after only 3 days of stagnant air.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=\"conclusions\" id=\"sec005\"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have presented a technique for mapping air pollution concentrations and sources using data from monitoring stations. As has been known from satellite and modeling studies, particulate pollution is an extensive problem affecting nearly all of China&#x02019;s population, but the observed heterogeneity of source locations could help develop strategies to reduce pollution.</p><p>We examined a four month interval as long-term station data were not available for most of China. Previous studies of both in situ and satellite data have indicated that winter and early spring months in China have somewhat higher PM concentrations due to increased use of fossil fuels for seasonal heating, weather patterns that concentrate pollution at low altitudes, and increased desert dust fluxes [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref012\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref027\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. In contrast, the air in China is typically cleanest from late summer to early fall. The April 5 to August 5 study period is somewhat intermediate. A review of hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> station data from Beijing (2009&#x02013;2014), Shanghai (2012&#x02013;2014), Guangzhou (2012&#x02013;2014), Chengdu (2013&#x02013;2014), and Shenyang (2014) indicates that the months studied in this paper averaged 91%, 84%, 89%, 72%, and 73% respectively of the annual averages (U.S. Air Quality Monitoring Program, <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.stateair.net/web/mission/1/\">http://www.stateair.net/web/mission/1/</ext-link>). Monthly-resolved PM<sub>2.5</sub> satellite data for the whole study region was not immediately available, but a monthly satellite history for Beijing reported that April-July averaged 99% of the annual mean during 2000 to 2012 [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref028\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. Hence, particulate pollution estimates drawn from the current short study period will likely be similar to or somewhat lower than long-term averages. Future work could explore seasonal variations and long-term trends.</p><p>During the four months studied, the population-weighted and area-weighted PM<sub>2.5</sub> averages were 52 and 46 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> respectively. Satellite pollution datasets generally focus on annual or multi-year averages, which limits the ability to make direct comparisons. However, the available satellite estimates tend to be similar to or somewhat lower than the ground observations. An analysis of the larger East Asia region estimated a population-weighted PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure of 50 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> for 2001 to 2010 [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref028\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. A version of the same dataset masked to the current study region had an area-weighted average of 40 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> from 2010 to 2012 [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref028\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref029\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>]. A different satellite estimate using similar observations but different calibrations and modeling gave 25 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> for the 2008 to 2010 average over the present study region [<xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref030\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0135749.ref031\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>].

Using prefecture level population and pollution data along with national average death rates for the five modeled diseases, we calculate that 1.6 million deaths / year can be attributed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> air pollution under the WHO model [95% confidence: 0.7 to 2.2 million deaths/year].

The upper right panel corresponds to the data reported in the main paper, and has a lifetime chosen such that 5% of the field area is allowed to be negative (same as <xref rid=\"pone.0135749.g004\" ref-type=\"fig\">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid=\"pone.0135749.s012\" ref-type=\"supplementary-material\">S8 Fig</xref>). The upper left panel, corresponds to choosing a decay lifetime such that 2% of the flux field is negative, the lower left panel has 15% negative area, and the lower right panel has no plume decay in the absence of rain (infinite lifetime). Rain events are explicitly excluded from consideration, and the reported flux aims to capture the man-made sources of pollution. In general, assuming a shorter plume lifetime implies higher and more diffuse fluxes in order to maintain the observed concentration patterns. By contrast, if the pollutant plumes are assumed to have a very long lifetime then the apparent man-made flux will implausibly turn negative over substantial regions. Though quantitatively important, the choice of effective lifetime has little qualitative impact on the distribution of large sources. The regions of locally higher flux remain similar under all scenarios.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0135749.s008.tif\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0135749.s009\"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Comparison of PM<sub>2.5</sub> patterns in early and late half of study.</title><p>Maps comparing PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations (top) and fluxes (bottom) during the first half of the sampling period (left column) and the second half of the sampling period (right).

Airborne particulate matter (PM) is especially detrimental to health [5–8], and has previously been estimated to cause between 3 and 7 million deaths every year, primarily by creating or worsening cardiorespiratory disease [2–4,6,7]. Particulate sources include electric power plants, industrial facilities, automobiles, biomass burning, and fossil fuels used in homes and factories for heating. In China, air pollution was previously estimated to contribute to 1.2 to 2 million deaths annually [2–4].\\n\\nIn 2012, China adopted the Ambient Air Quality Standard [9], and began development of a national Air Reporting System that now includes 945 sites in 190 cities. These automated stations report hourly via the internet, and focus on six pollutants: particulate matter < 2.5 microns (PM2.5), particulate matter < 10 microns (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). Provincial governments perform air quality monitoring at 600 additional locations that are not yet integrated into the national system. Previous studies of regional scale air pollution have generally relied on satellite data [10,11] or modeling [12,13], but the high density of hourly data in China now allows regional patterns to be constructed directly from ground observations.\\n\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\nThough China deserves praise for its monitoring system and transparent communication, most archived observations are not publicly available. To compensate, real-time data was downloaded every hour during a four month interval from April 5, 2014 to August 5, 2014. Due to download restrictions on the official Chinese air quality reporting system, two different third-party sources were used: PM25.in and AQICN.org. PM25.in is a direct mirror of data from the 945 stations in China’s national network, while AQICN.org is the world’s largest aggregator of real-time air quality data and included many additional sites in China and surrounding areas. Nearly all of the additional data from within China originates from stations operated by provincial environmental agencies that have not yet been incorporated in China’s national network.\\n\\nConsistency, quality control, and validation checks were applied to the raw data prior to further analysis in order to reduce the impact of outliers, badly calibrated instruments, and other problems. The most common quality problem was associated with stuck instruments that implausibly reported the same concentration continuously for many hours. A regional consistency check was also applied to verify that each station was reporting data similar to its neighboring stations. Approximately 8% of the data was removed as a result of the quality control review. Further details are described in the supplemental material (S1 Text).\\n\\nAs little monitoring is conducted in western China (Fig 1); we will focus on China east of 95° E, which includes 97% of the population. After removing stations with a high percentage of missing values or with other quality control problems, this study used 880 national network sites, 640 other sites in China and Taiwan, and 236 sites in other countries within 500 km of China (mostly South Korea). The air quality network is skewed towards urban areas, often with several sites per city and fewer, if any, in rural areas. For the n-th site, we use pn(t) to denote the pollutant concentration time series and pn¯ to denote the mean pollutant concentration.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135749.g001Fig 1 Map of real-time air pollution monitoring stations.Map shows the locations of air quality monitoring sites in China and surrounding areas with sufficient hourly data to be included in this study. Selection criteria and data sources are described in S1 Text. The map was prepared in MATLAB using political boundaries from the Global Database of Administrative Areas (version 2; http://gadm.org/).\\n\\nFor each pollutant, a correlation vs. distance function was estimated by computing all possible pairwise correlations between different stations and fitting the resulting correlations to a two part exponential decay as a function of distance. The resulting functional forms are stated in S2 Table and shown in S2 and S3 Figs. The correlation functions are used to construct correlation matrices that in turn are used to compute Kriging coefficients [14, 15], Kn(x→).\\n\\nThe interpolated pollutant field, P(x→,t), is then estimated in two parts.P(x\\n\\n→\\n\\n,\\n\\nt)\\n\\n=\\n\\nS(x\\n\\n→\\n\\n)\\n\\n+\\n\\nA(x\\n\\n→\\n\\n,\\n\\nt)S(x\\n\\n→\\n\\n)\\n\\n=\\n\\n(\\n\\n∑\\n\\nn\\n\\nK\\n\\nn\\n\\n(x\\n\\n→\\n\\n)\\n\\n(p\\n\\nn¯\\n\\n−\\n\\nG(x\\n\\n→n)\\n\\n)\\n\\n)\\n\\n+\\n\\nG(x\\n\\n→\\n\\n)A(x\\n\\n→\\n\\n,\\n\\nt)\\n\\n=\\n\\n∑\\n\\nn\\n\\nK\\n\\nn\\n\\n*\\n\\n(x\\n\\n→\\n\\n,\\n\\nt)\\n\\n(p\\n\\nn\\n\\n(\\n\\nt\\n\\n)\\n\\n−p\\n\\nn¯\\n\\n)\\n\\nThe stationary part, S(x→), is derived by applying Kriging interpolation to the mean pollutant concentrations and a global predictor, G(x→n), that depends on latitude and longitude and contains free parameters that are adjusted to fit the observed means. The time-dependent anomaly part, A(x→,t), depends only on the fluctuations at each station relative to the local mean, and its Kriging coefficients, Kn*(x→n,t), are computed with restriction to stations that are active at time t. This two-step process reduces errors associated with stations that have intermittently missing data. This method is similar to that used by Berkeley Earth for its historical earth temperature analysis [16]. Since the correlation vs. distance function has been constructed with the correlation at zero distance obtaining a value less than one, the resulting interpolated fields will be smoother than the original data. This design was chosen for its ability to compensate for noise in the underlying station measurements. Additional details of the interpolation process are provided in the supplement methods (S1 Text).\\n\\nFor mapping and computation, this continuous field was sampled with an approximately 6 km resolution, though in practice, the characteristic size of resolvable features is often larger (e.g. 30 km) and varies with station density and noise.\\n\\nA simple estimate of pollutant fluxes, F(x→,t), was computed by comparing observed changes in the hourly pollutant concentration to the concentrations expected due to short-term wind transport v→(x→,t) and an exponential decay with lifetime τ.

Flux averages were computed by time-averaging the resulting field after excluding outlying values and cells affected by rain events as determined from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data [18, 19].\\n\\nThe change in mortality due to PM2.5 air pollution was calculated by adopting the integrated exposure response function approach [20] which considers relative risk of death for five disease classes (stroke, ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infection) and which was adopted by World Health Organization (WHO) for the Global Burden of Disease study [21]. The model incorporates non-linear response versus concentration and provides an estimate of uncertainty. Relative risk was calculated at the prefecture level using local average PM2.5 concentration. The data for different diseases and prefectures was then combined to construct national average mortality estimates.\\n\\nAnalysis and figure rendering was performed using original software written for this project on the MATLAB platform (version 2014a; http://www.mathworks.com/). Additional details of these calculations and associated background information is provided in the supplemental methods document (S1 Text).\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nFig 2 shows a time series of PM2.5 concentration at Beijing and interpolated maps at three time points separated by 6 hours each. This shows the volatile nature of air pollution and the role of weather patterns in redistributing pollution on short timescales. Our approach creates a smooth field that approximates the data at each station, but allows a degree of difference attributable to noise. The pollution is extensive and rapidly evolves in response to winds and other atmospheric conditions. In the figure, fresh air from the North displaces a period of heavy pollution. Hourly data allows us to capture this evolution and ultimately estimate source fluxes. S1 Movie shows the time evolution of PM2.5 across the entire country.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135749.g002Fig 2 Time evolution of PM2.5 pollution in the vicinity of Beijing.(Top) Time series of PM2.5 concentration at Beijing extracted from the interpolated field.

Concentrations are shown using color gradients and contour lines; the colors (green, yellow, etc.) represent US EPA qualitative health impacts. Pollution concentrations were computed as described in the text using hourly data and then the hourly concentration fields were averaged over the four month study duration. The resulting maps were rendered using MATLAB.\\n\\nAir pollution is extensive in China, with the highest particulate concentrations observed south of Beijing (e.g. Xingtai / Handan), but significant levels extend throughout the interior, which is consistent with previous satellite and modeling estimates [11–13]. Extensive pollution is not surprising since particulate matter can remain airborne for days to weeks and travel thousands of kilometers. The corridor south of Beijing contains the highest pollution concentrations and, as discussed below, many of the largest sources. During this study, the southern coastal area experienced somewhat better air quality, possibly linked to greater rainfall (S1 Fig).\\n\\nFor PM2.5, portions of China encompassing roughly 38% of the population are classified as “unhealthy” on average (>55 μg/m3, red) with an additional 45% of the population averaging “unhealthy for sensitive groups” (>35 μg/m3, orange). Almost none of the study area averaged below the US EPA’s 12 μg/m3 standard for annual average PM2.5 exposure (green). The area-weighted average was 46 μg/m3 and the population-weighted average exposure to PM2.5 was 52 μg/m3. 92% of China’s population experienced unhealthy PM2.5 for at least 120 hours during the study period. 46% of China’s population experienced PM2.5 above the highest EPA threshold (“hazardous”, >250 μg/m3), during at least one hour in the observation period.\\n\\nPatterns for PM10 are similar but less severe, with average PM10 levels “moderate” for most of China. Ozone concentrations are modest across most of China, though higher levels occur in the Northwest desert area, and in a small number of Northeastern cities. Though the average levels of PM10 and O3 are “moderate” or “good” for much of China, intermittently high levels of these pollutants can occur in some areas.\\n\\n\\nSource Regions for Air Pollution in China\\n\\n\\nFig 4 shows estimated pollutant fluxes for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2. Pollution emission is often localized, especially in the Beijing to Shanghai corridor where many of the highest PM concentrations also occur (Fig 3). Most of the largest emissions appear in or near urban areas (e.g. Handan, Shijazhuang, Zibo, Tangshan, Linyi, Hangshou), though not all major cities have high pollution fluxes (e.g. Chongqing, Chengdu, Wuhan). The source map presumably reflects patterns of industrial activity, though detailed differences will not be explored here.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135749.g004Fig 4 Air pollution source maps.Maps of average pollutant flux for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 for eastern China (top row) and the Beijing to Shanghai corridor (bottom row). Pollutant fluxes were computed as described in the text from changes in the interpolated hourly pollution fields along with contemporaneous wind and weather data. Due to sparse sampling and secondary transformations of pollutants in the atmosphere, apparent source fluxes are likely to appear more diffuse than the true emissions source.\\n\\nNO2 and SO2 emissions help suggest the pollution source. Nitrogen oxides, including nitric oxide (NO) and NO2 are created when air is heated, and on average have been attributed to transportation fuels (15–25%), fossil fuel burning in power plants (30–50%), and to industrial facilities (25–35%) [23, 24]. It is expected that NO dominates at the combustion source, but in the presence of sunlight NO and NO2 will equilibrate within a few minutes (as well as reacting with O3), implying that NO2 measurements reflect a combination of NO and NO2 emissions. SO2 emissions have been previously associated with coal (~90%) in power plants and industrial facilities [25]. Beijing has negligible SO2 flux, despite a large NO2 signal, possibly a result of policies that limit coal burning in the immediate vicinity of Beijing and more extensively apply mitigation technologies.\\n\\nMany of the SO2 and NO2 sources are also sources of PM pollution. This is not surprising since fossil fuel burning is also a major source of PM2.5 and PM10. However, the PM sources appear more diffuse than either the SO2 or NO2 sources. In part, this is caused by secondary particulate matter formed within the atmosphere from other pollutants, such as SO2 or NO2 [26]. Secondary particulate formation may cause PM fluxes to appear more widely distributed than the underlying emitters. Nonetheless, many strong PM sources are identified through this analysis. Within the study region, 10% of the area is responsible for 34% of the PM2.5 emissions, and 5% of the area is responsible for 22% of emissions. However, small and moderate sources are also important. Approximately 37% of the study region had PM2.5 fluxes >0.5 μg/m3/hr, sufficient to exceed US EPA standards after only 3 days of stagnant air.\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWe have presented a technique for mapping air pollution concentrations and sources using data from monitoring stations. As has been known from satellite and modeling studies, particulate pollution is an extensive problem affecting nearly all of China’s population, but the observed heterogeneity of source locations could help develop strategies to reduce pollution.\\n\\nWe examined a four month interval as long-term station data were not available for most of China. Previous studies of both in situ and satellite data have indicated that winter and early spring months in China have somewhat higher PM concentrations due to increased use of fossil fuels for seasonal heating, weather patterns that concentrate pollution at low altitudes, and increased desert dust fluxes [12, 27]. In contrast, the air in China is typically cleanest from late summer to early fall. The April 5 to August 5 study period is somewhat intermediate. A review of hourly PM2.5 station data from Beijing (2009–2014), Shanghai (2012–2014), Guangzhou (2012–2014), Chengdu (2013–2014), and Shenyang (2014) indicates that the months studied in this paper averaged 91%, 84%, 89%, 72%, and 73% respectively of the annual averages (U.S. Air Quality Monitoring Program, http://www.stateair.net/web/mission/1/). Monthly-resolved PM2.5 satellite data for the whole study region was not immediately available, but a monthly satellite history for Beijing reported that April-July averaged 99% of the annual mean during 2000 to 2012 [28]. Hence, particulate pollution estimates drawn from the current short study period will likely be similar to or somewhat lower than long-term averages. Future work could explore seasonal variations and long-term trends.\\n\\nDuring the four months studied, the population-weighted and area-weighted PM2.5 averages were 52 and 46 μg/m3 respectively. Satellite pollution datasets generally focus on annual or multi-year averages, which limits the ability to make direct comparisons. However, the available satellite estimates tend to be similar to or somewhat lower than the ground observations. An analysis of the larger East Asia region estimated a population-weighted PM2.5 exposure of 50 μg/m3 for 2001 to 2010 [28]. A version of the same dataset masked to the current study region had an area-weighted average of 40 μg/m3 from 2010 to 2012 [28, 29]. A different satellite estimate using similar observations but different calibrations and modeling gave 25 μg/m3 for the 2008 to 2010 average over the present study region [30, 31]. Both of these datasets show similar spatial patterns to what we observe (Fig 5), though the magnitudes in van Donkelaar et al.’s work [28] are clearly more consistent with our ground data estimates. As noted in previous satellite to in situ comparisons, satellite data may be more likely to underestimate pollution concentrations during the most extreme pollution events [28, 32].\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0135749.g005Fig 5 Comparison of PM2.5 observations to satellite data.Maps of average PM2.5 concentration from this study (top) and two satellite-derived datasets restricted to the same region. The average over the 2008 to 2010 time interval was chosen for the satellite data due to the limitations of the available satellite data. Both the concentrations reported by van Donkelaar [28] (middle) and those reported by de Sherbinin [30] (bottom) rely on similar satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (obtained by NASA), but interpret those observations differently when determining pollutant concentration. The satellite-derived data was imported from concentration data files provided by their respected sources and rendered via MATLAB to use the same US EPA health category color scheme applied in Figs 2 and 3.\\n\\nThe conversion of pollution concentrations to mortality is complicated. We adopt the framework [20] developed for the WHO Global Burden of Disease study [21] that considers PM2.5 mortality due to impacts on five distinct diseases and accounts for nonlinearities as a function of concentration. Using prefecture level population and pollution data along with national average death rates for the five modeled diseases, we calculate that 1.6 million deaths / year can be attributed to PM2.5 air pollution under the WHO model [95% confidence: 0.7 to 2.2 million deaths/year]. This is equivalent to 4 thousand deaths / day or 17% of all deaths in China. Additional details appear in S1 Text and S1 Table. For perspective, the categories of mortality events considered by the WHO model, e.g. cardiorespiratory deaths, account for roughly 55% of all Chinese deaths [21]. This compares to only 42% of mortality in the United States in the same cardiorespiratory categories, despite much higher incidence of obesity in the United States [21]. The calculated mortality is somewhat higher than the 1.2 million deaths/year previously estimated from the Huai River study using Chinese air pollution measurements and mortality data [3,4,33].\\n\\nThough most of China is subject to potentially harmful levels of PM2.5, some large population centers (Chongqing, Wuhan, Chengdu) emit less than half the PM2.5 of others. Among northeastern cities, Beijing has relatively low emissions except for NO2. Low SO2 fluxes may indicate cities that benefit from lower coal usage or better smokestack pollution controls. Compared to natural gas, coal produces 150 to 400 times more PM for the same energy delivered [34,35]. China has plans for new coal plants in the next decade that could effectively double their coal consumption [36], potentially exacerbating the problem of air pollution. A table of pollution concentrations and fluxes by province and prefecture is included in S1 Table.\\n\\nThe methods of this study should be applicable to air quality monitoring in other regions of the world. However, these techniques require an extensive air-quality monitoring network with frequent updates (e.g. hourly), and such networks presently exist in only a few places. We hope that other countries will follow China’s lead and provide both extensive and transparent real-time air quality monitoring.\\n\\n\\nSupporting InformationS1 Text\\n\\n\\nSupplemental Methods.\\n\\nAdditional discussion of methods, data handling, and validation.\\n\\n(DOCX)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.S1 Table\\n\\n\\nProvince and prefecture pollution and mortality data.\\n\\nProvides pollution concentration and flux data broken down by geographic regions within China.

The upper right panel corresponds to the data reported in the main paper, and has a lifetime chosen such that 5% of the field area is allowed to be negative (same as Fig 4 and S8 Fig). The upper left panel, corresponds to choosing a decay lifetime such that 2% of the flux field is negative, the lower left panel has 15% negative area, and the lower right panel has no plume decay in the absence of rain (infinite lifetime). Rain events are explicitly excluded from consideration, and the reported flux aims to capture the man-made sources of pollution. In general, assuming a shorter plume lifetime implies higher and more diffuse fluxes in order to maintain the observed concentration patterns. By contrast, if the pollutant plumes are assumed to have a very long lifetime then the apparent man-made flux will implausibly turn negative over substantial regions. Though quantitatively important, the choice of effective lifetime has little qualitative impact on the distribution of large sources. The regions of locally higher flux remain similar under all scenarios.\\n\\n(TIF)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.S5 Fig\\n\\n\\nComparison of PM2.5 patterns in early and late half of study.\\n\\nMaps comparing PM2.5 concentrations (top) and fluxes (bottom) during the first half of the sampling period (left column) and the second half of the sampling period (right).

The limited coverage of this map is a consequence of the short correlation length for SO2 (S2 Table; S2 Fig), which limits the distance over which one can usefully interpolate SO2. In part, the short correlation length is a consequence of the short lifetime of SO2 in the atmosphere, which makes estimates far from measurement sites highly uncertain.\\n\\n(EPS)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.S12 Fig\\n\\n\\nSO2 sources across China.\\n\\nLarger version of panel from Fig 4 presenting SO2 source fluxes across China.\\n\\n(EPS)\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.S13 Fig\\n\\n\\nAverage NO2 concentration across China.\\n\\nMap of NO2 concentrations across China.

RD significantly reduced the onset of neurological deficit and death in SHRSP, and this protection against stroke by RD was associated with the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF), the suppression of blood&#x02013;brain barrier disruption, the limitation of white matter (WM) lesions, and the attenuation of macrophage infiltration and activated microglia. Furthermore, RD significantly attenuated brain oxidative stress, and NADPH oxidase subunits, P67 and Rac1 in SHRSP. On the other hand, hydralazine, with similar blood pressure lowering to RD, did not significantly suppress the onset of stroke and brain injury in SHRSP. Furthermore, RD prevented cardiac remodeling and vascular endothelial impairment in SHRSP.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our present work provided the first experimental evidence that RD can prevent hypertensive stroke and brain injury, beyond blood pressure lowering, thereby highlighting RD as a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke as well as hypertension.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>renal denervation</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>sympathetic nerve</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple lines of evidence indicate that renal nerves, composed of efferent sympathetic nerves and afferent sensory nerves, are involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension and chronic kidney disease.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b1\">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b5\">5</xref></sup> Renal efferent sympathetic nerve activation enhances volume retention and sodium reabsorption in the kidney, reduces renal blood flow, and activates renin&#x02010;angiotensin&#x02010;aldosterone system.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b4\">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b5\">5</xref></sup> On the other hand, renal afferent sensory nerves transmit important sensory information to the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN), and in turn PVN transmits the information to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the vasomotor center that determines basal sympathetic nerve activity.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b2\">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b6\">6</xref></sup></p><p>A proof&#x02010;of&#x02010;concept study<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b7\">7</xref></sup> and a subsequent randomized&#x02010;controlled trial<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b8\">8</xref></sup> have demonstrated that catheter&#x02010;based bilateral renal denervation (RD) can cause a significant and sustained reduction of blood pressure (BP) in patients with treatment&#x02010;resistant hypertension.

Male stroke&#x02010;prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were purchased from Japan SLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment I: Effect of RD on Stroke and Survival Rate in SHRSP</title><p>To examine the effect of bilateral renal denervation (RD) on incidental stroke in SHRSP, 9&#x02010;week&#x02010;old SHRSP were fed an 8% NaCl diet (high&#x02010;salt), and were randomly assigned to 4 groups, including (1) high&#x02010;salt only, (2) high&#x02010;salt+sham operation, (3) high&#x02010;salt+RD, and (4) high&#x02010;salt+hydralazine treatment (5 mg/kg per day). Hydralazine was given orally to rats as the drinking water. SHRSP fed a 0.3% NaCl diet (low&#x02010;salt) served as the control. The appearance of major stroke&#x02010;associated signs, including paralytic gait, reduced motor activity, and sudden death, was carefully monitored every day for 50 days, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b12\">12</xref></sup> When 1 or more of these signs occurred in SHRSP, they were regarded as stroke sign&#x02010;positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment II: Effect of RD on Brain Injury in SHRSP</title><p>To examine the effect of RD on brain injury in SHRSP, 9&#x02010;week&#x02010;old SHRSP fed an 8% NaCl diet (high&#x02010;salt) were assigned to the same 4 groups as the above&#x02010;mentioned Experiment I. At 3 weeks after RD, sham operation, or hydralazine treatment, all groups of SHRSP were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and the rats were perfused with phosphate&#x02010;buffered saline. The brain, heart, carotid arteries, and kidneys were rapidly excised from the rats for estimation of various parameters, including cerebral blood flow, white matter lesion, blood&#x02013;brain barrier disruption, inflammatory cell infiltration, oxidative stress, vascular endothelial function, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, renal norepinephrine content, and plasma renin activity etc, as described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment III: Effect of RD and Hydralazine on Blood Pressure in SHRSP</title><p>To examine the comparative effect of RD and hydralazine on blood pressure in SHRSP, 6&#x02010;week&#x02010;old SHRSP (n=15) were subjected to implantation of miniaturized telemetry devices to measure direct BP. At 9 weeks of age, they were fed an 8% NaCl (high&#x02010;salt) in the same manner as Experiments I and II, and were divided into 3 groups, including (1) high&#x02010;salt+sham operation, (2) high&#x02010;salt+RD, and (3) high&#x02010;salt+hydralazine treatment (5 mg/kg per day). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) of these rats were measured over 14 consecutive days after these treatments, as described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Renal Denervation (RD) and Sham Surgery</title><p>To perform RD, SHRSP were placed in a prone position, under general anesthesia with isoflurane. To minimize invasive approach to the kidney, the incision was made in the dorsal midline. The traction of the erector spinae muscles exposed the kidney. Thereby, the renal arteries and veins were identified. After isolating the vessels from connective tissue, all visible nerves along the vessels were cut. Furthermore the vessels were painted with a solution of 10% phenol in absolute ethanol.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b13\">13</xref></sup> Then the vessels were washed with saline and the skin was closed. This method ablates both the afferent and efferent renal nerves. In the sham&#x02010;operation group of SHRSP, the kidneys were exposed in the same manner as the RD group but the vessels were not stripped or painted with phenol. The achievement of RD was confirmed by evaluating whether the renal tissue content of norepinephrine was &#x0003c;10% of the mean value in the sham&#x02010;operated group.</p></sec><sec><title>Direct Measurement of Blood Pressure With Telemetry</title><p>We used a telemetry system (TA11PA&#x02010;C40; Data Sciences International, St Paul, MN) to record arterial pressure in SHRSP, as described in detail.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b14\">14</xref></sup> Six&#x02010;week&#x02010;old SHRSP were anesthetized with isoflurane and were surgically implanted with miniaturized telemetry devices in the abdominal cavity. The blood pressure catheter was placed into the abdominal aorta. BP signals and HR derived from pressure waves from abdominal aorta were measured in conscious and unrestrained animals. After 2 weeks of recovery, 24&#x02010;hour online recordings were digitized (1 kHz) and stored for further analysis. BP and HR data were obtained from each implanted animal, and BP and HR data were recorded as 5&#x02010;minute averages every 60 minutes using a computer system (DATAQUEST ART4.2 Acquisition; Data Sciences International).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Cerebral Blood Flow</title><p>After 3 weeks of RD, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) of SHRSP was recorded by a laser speckle blood flow imager (Omega Zone; Omegawave), as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b15\">15</xref></sup> Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and the rectal temperature was kept at 37.0&#x000b1;0.5&#x000b0;C. After the rats were placed in the prone position, the skull was exposed by a midline scalp incision. Then, the surface of the region of bilateral cerebral hemispheres was diffusely illuminated by 780 nm semiconductor laser light. Color&#x02010;coded blood flow images obtained in high&#x02010;resolution mode (638&#x000d7;480 pixels; 1 image/second) were captured by a CCD camera positioned above head and transferred to a computer for analysis. The settings of CCD camera and color image program were kept the same among all the measurements. Images were analyzed by the color image program incorporated in the flowmetry system to obtain the average value of blood flow. The mean CBF of 10 measurements in each group was determined. The value of CBF was expressed as a percentage of low&#x02010;salt group.

The major findings of our present work were that RD significantly prevented the onset of stroke and the progression of brain injury in hypertensive rats, and these brain&#x02010;protective effects of RD were at least in part, mediated by BP&#x02010;independent effects, including attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation, and suppression of BBB disruption. Therefore, our present work provided the first evidence supporting that RD seems to be a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke in hypertension.</p><p>In the present study, to determine the effectiveness of RD on stroke in hypertension, we used high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP, since SHRSP is regarded as an established and popular model of hypertensive stroke.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b12\">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b23\">23</xref></sup> In agreement with our previous reports,<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b12\">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b23\">23</xref></sup> high&#x02010;salt intake significantly accelerated stroke incidence and brain injury in SHRSP, which is consistent with clinical evidence<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b24\">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b28\">28</xref></sup> that excessive salt intake is an important risk factor for stroke. Of note, RD significantly reduced the incidence of neurological deficit and death in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP, despite the very small BP&#x02010;lowering effect of RD in SHRSP. On the other hand, hydralazine treatment with similar small BP&#x02010;lowering effect to RD did not significantly prevent stroke in SHRSP. These results demonstrate that the mechanism underlying prevention of stroke by RD in SHRSP is mediated by BP&#x02010;independent effect. Furthermore, RD significantly attenuated the decrease in cerebral blood flow and significantly prevented the progression of white matter lesion in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP. On the contrary, hydralazine failed to attenuate these changes induced by high&#x02010;salt in SHRSP. These results indicate that RD prevented the disturbance of cerebral blood flow and progression of white matter lesion independently of BP. Furthermore, RD significantly limited disruption of BBB in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP, being accompanied by the suppression of downregulation of occludin,<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b29\">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b30\">30</xref></sup> a key tight junction protein involved in intact BBB function, while hydralazine treatment failed to limit these changes in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP. Therefore, the protective effect of RD against stroke in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP seems to be at least partially mediated by the improvement of cerebral blood flow and inhibition of BBB disruption.</p><p>In the present work, it is worthy to note that RD significantly ameliorated the increase in inflammatory cells such as macrophage, and activated microglia and astrocyte in cortex, white matter, and PVN regions in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP, while hydralazine did not attenuate them. These findings imply that RD exerts anti&#x02010;inflammatory effects in the brain of SHRSP. Accumulating evidence<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b31\">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b34\">34</xref></sup> supports the notion that oxidative stress and inflammation play a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke and brain injury, through formation of a vicious cycle. Previously, we have reported that antioxidant significantly slows the incidence of stroke in high salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP, and this is associated with attenuation of cerebral inflammation, thereby indicating the critical role of brain oxidative stress in the mechanism of stoke in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b20\">20</xref></sup> Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of RD on brain oxidative stress in SHRSP. RD, but not hydralazine, significantly reduced oxidative stress in cortex, white matter, and PVN of SHRSP. Furthermore, RD, but not hydralazine, significantly prevented the increase in NADPH oxidase subunits, P67 and Rac1 in SHRSP. These results show that RD attenuated brain oxidative stress beyond BP&#x02010;lowering effect. Collectively, our present work supports the notion that the attenuation of brain oxidative stress by RD is involved in the prevention of stroke in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP.</p><p>A growing body of clinical evidence<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b35\">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b36\">36</xref></sup> and experimental work including SHRSP<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b23\">23</xref></sup> show that renin&#x02010;angiotensin system participates in the pathophysiology of stroke and brain injury. In the present study, plasma renin activity was significantly reduced by RD in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP, indicating the suppression of circulating renin&#x02010;angiotensin system by RD. Previously we have found that angiotensin II is directly involved in the progression of stroke in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b23\">23</xref></sup> Therefore, not only attenuation of brain oxidative stress but also suppression of circulating renin&#x02010;angiotensin system appears to account for the protective effects of RD against stroke and brain injury.</p><p>The method of RD used in the present work causes denervation of afferent renal sensory nerves as well as efferent renal sympathetic nerves. Substantial evidence indicates that afferent renal sensory nerves project directly to various areas in the central nervous system involved in the regulation of cardiovascular system.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b4\">4</xref></sup> Previous experimental studies<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b37\">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref></sup> show that renal injury such as ischemia, through afferent renal nerve, significantly activates the central sympathetic nervous system, thereby leading to the enhancement of systemic sympathetic nerve activity. Furthermore, patients with chronic renal failure are characterized by the enhancement of muscle sympathetic nerve activity through renal afferent nerves.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b40\">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b41\">41</xref></sup> Thus, it is proposed that renal afferent nerves are a key regulator of peripheral sympathetic nerve activity as well as the central sympathetic nervous system. Recent clinical studies show that RD significantly attenuates muscle sympathetic nerve activity<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b42\">42</xref></sup> and improves cardiac hypertrophy and function,<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b10\">10</xref></sup> atrial fibrillation,<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b11\">11</xref></sup> glucose intolerance<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b43\">43</xref></sup> in patients with resistant hypertension, thereby supporting the concept that RD can have the benefit in prevention of cardiovascular injury through afferent renal nerve ablation. However, it remains to be determined whether these potential organ protective effects of RD in hypertensive patients are secondary to BP&#x02010;lowering or not. In the present work, notably, RD, but not hydralazine, significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac macrophage infiltration, and cardiac fibrosis and also prevented the impairment of vascular endothelial function in high&#x02010;salt&#x02010;loaded SHRSP. These results suggest that BP&#x02010;independent protective effects of RD against stroke and cardiovascular injury observed in the present work might be attributed, at least partially, to the ablation of renal afferent nerves.</p><sec><title>Study Limitation</title><p>The present work did not allow us to define the direct mechanism underlying brain protection by RD in SHRSP and to determine how various pleiotrophic effects of RD observed in this study are linked to each other. As described above, we have previously shown that renin&#x02010;angiotensin system and oxidative stress both are directly involved in the progression of stroke and brain injury in SHRSP, through induction of inflammation, ischemia, and blood&#x02013;brain barrier disruption.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b12\">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b23\">23</xref></sup> Therefore, it is likely that the suppression of oxidative stress and renin&#x02010;angiotensin system by RD might be the main mechanisms leading to brain protection (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig12\">Figure 12</xref>). However, further study is required to demonstrate our proposal.</p><fig id=\"fig12\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism underlying the protection of stroke and brain injury by renal denervation.

Therefore, we propose that RD seems to be a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke in hypertensive patients. However, future clinical study is needed to elucidate our proposal.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><title>Sources of Funding</title><fn fn-type=\"financial-disclosure\"><p>This work was

\"\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nMultiple lines of evidence indicate that renal nerves, composed of efferent sympathetic nerves and afferent sensory nerves, are involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension and chronic kidney disease.1–5 Renal efferent sympathetic nerve activation enhances volume retention and sodium reabsorption in the kidney, reduces renal blood flow, and activates renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system.4–5 On the other hand, renal afferent sensory nerves transmit important sensory information to the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN), and in turn PVN transmits the information to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the vasomotor center that determines basal sympathetic nerve activity.2–3,6\\n\\nA proof‐of‐concept study7 and a subsequent randomized‐controlled trial8 have demonstrated that catheter‐based bilateral renal denervation (RD) can cause a significant and sustained reduction of blood pressure (BP) in patients with treatment‐resistant hypertension. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that muscle sympathetic nerve activity and systemic norepinephrine spillover are significantly reduced after RD in a single patient with resistant hypertension.9 RD reduces left ventricular hypertrophy and improves cardiac function10 in patients with resistant hypertension. Furthermore, RD provides rate control and reduces susceptibility to arterial fibrillation (AF) in patients with permanent AF.11 These previous reports support the notion that reduction of renal afferent nerve traffic caused by RD might elicit inhibition of central sympathetic activity, thereby suggesting the possibility that RD may have the benefit in prevention of cerebrovascular and cardiac events independently of BP.\\n\\nThe present study, using a rat model of hypertensive stroke, was undertaken to demonstrate our hypothesis that RD can prevent stroke and brain injury independently of BP‐lowering effect. We obtained the first experimental evidence that RD can prevent hypertensive stroke and brain injury beyond BP‐lowering effect.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\n\\nExperimental Animals\\n\\nAll experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines for the care and use of animals established by Kumamoto University. Male stroke‐prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were purchased from Japan SLC.\\n\\n\\nExperiment I: Effect of RD on Stroke and Survival Rate in SHRSP\\n\\nTo examine the effect of bilateral renal denervation (RD) on incidental stroke in SHRSP, 9‐week‐old SHRSP were fed an 8% NaCl diet (high‐salt), and were randomly assigned to 4 groups, including (1) high‐salt only, (2) high‐salt+sham operation, (3) high‐salt+RD, and (4) high‐salt+hydralazine treatment (5 mg/kg per day). Hydralazine was given orally to rats as the drinking water. SHRSP fed a 0.3% NaCl diet (low‐salt) served as the control. The appearance of major stroke‐associated signs, including paralytic gait, reduced motor activity, and sudden death, was carefully monitored every day for 50 days, as previously described.12 When 1 or more of these signs occurred in SHRSP, they were regarded as stroke sign‐positive.\\n\\n\\nExperiment II: Effect of RD on Brain Injury in SHRSP\\n\\nTo examine the effect of RD on brain injury in SHRSP, 9‐week‐old SHRSP fed an 8% NaCl diet (high‐salt) were assigned to the same 4 groups as the above‐mentioned Experiment I. At 3 weeks after RD, sham operation, or hydralazine treatment, all groups of SHRSP were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and the rats were perfused with phosphate‐buffered saline. The brain, heart, carotid arteries, and kidneys were rapidly excised from the rats for estimation of various parameters, including cerebral blood flow, white matter lesion, blood–brain barrier disruption, inflammatory cell infiltration, oxidative stress, vascular endothelial function, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, renal norepinephrine content, and plasma renin activity etc, as described below.\\n\\n\\nExperiment III: Effect of RD and Hydralazine on Blood Pressure in SHRSP\\n\\nTo examine the comparative effect of RD and hydralazine on blood pressure in SHRSP, 6‐week‐old SHRSP (n=15) were subjected to implantation of miniaturized telemetry devices to measure direct BP. At 9 weeks of age, they were fed an 8% NaCl (high‐salt) in the same manner as Experiments I and II, and were divided into 3 groups, including (1) high‐salt+sham operation, (2) high‐salt+RD, and (3) high‐salt+hydralazine treatment (5 mg/kg per day). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) of these rats were measured over 14 consecutive days after these treatments, as described below.\\n\\n\\nRenal Denervation (RD) and Sham Surgery\\n\\nTo perform RD, SHRSP were placed in a prone position, under general anesthesia with isoflurane. To minimize invasive approach to the kidney, the incision was made in the dorsal midline. The traction of the erector spinae muscles exposed the kidney. Thereby, the renal arteries and veins were identified. After isolating the vessels from connective tissue, all visible nerves along the vessels were cut. Furthermore the vessels were painted with a solution of 10% phenol in absolute ethanol.13 Then the vessels were washed with saline and the skin was closed. This method ablates both the afferent and efferent renal nerves. In the sham‐operation group of SHRSP, the kidneys were exposed in the same manner as the RD group but the vessels were not stripped or painted with phenol. The achievement of RD was confirmed by evaluating whether the renal tissue content of norepinephrine was <10% of the mean value in the sham‐operated group.\\n\\n\\nDirect Measurement of Blood Pressure With Telemetry\\n\\nWe used a telemetry system (TA11PA‐C40; Data Sciences International, St Paul, MN) to record arterial pressure in SHRSP, as described in detail.14 Six‐week‐old SHRSP were anesthetized with isoflurane and were surgically implanted with miniaturized telemetry devices in the abdominal cavity. The blood pressure catheter was placed into the abdominal aorta. BP signals and HR derived from pressure waves from abdominal aorta were measured in conscious and unrestrained animals. After 2 weeks of recovery, 24‐hour online recordings were digitized (1 kHz) and stored for further analysis. BP and HR data were obtained from each implanted animal, and BP and HR data were recorded as 5‐minute averages every 60 minutes using a computer system (DATAQUEST ART4.2 Acquisition; Data Sciences International).\\n\\n\\nMeasurement of Cerebral Blood Flow\\n\\nAfter 3 weeks of RD, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) of SHRSP was recorded by a laser speckle blood flow imager (Omega Zone; Omegawave), as described previously.15 Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and the rectal temperature was kept at 37.0±0.5°C. After the rats were placed in the prone position, the skull was exposed by a midline scalp incision. Then, the surface of the region of bilateral cerebral hemispheres was diffusely illuminated by 780 nm semiconductor laser light. Color‐coded blood flow images obtained in high‐resolution mode (638×480 pixels; 1 image/second) were captured by a CCD camera positioned above head and transferred to a computer for analysis. The settings of CCD camera and color image program were kept the same among all the measurements. Images were analyzed by the color image program incorporated in the flowmetry system to obtain the average value of blood flow. The mean CBF of 10 measurements in each group was determined. The value of CBF was expressed as a percentage of low‐salt group. All measurements were performed in a blinded fashion.\\n\\n\\nMeasurement of White Matter Lesions\\n\\nThe brain samples were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde overnight, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5‐μm thick sections. The samples were subjected to Klüver‐Barrera staining for the measurement of white matter lesions. The severity of the white matter lesions in the corpus callosum were graded on a 4‐point scale: normal (grade 0), disarrangement of the nerve fibers (grade 1), formation of marked vacuoles (grade 2), and disappearance of myelinated fibers (grade 3).15–16 All measurements were performed in a blinded fashion.\\n\\n\\nMeasurement of IgG Extravasation\\n\\nImmunolocalization of brain IgG was evaluated in a blinded fashion, as described previously.17–18 Briefly, the sections were incubated in the presence of 0.3% H2O2 and with rabbit anti‐rat IgG‐HRP (Invitrogen) for 1 hour. After washing with PBS, the reaction product was visualized with diaminobenzidine. IgG immunoreactivity was quantified in whole brain with Lumina Vision version 2.2.0 analysis software (Mitani Corporation). The mean value in low‐salt group was expressed as 1.0.\\n\\n\\nImmunohistochemical Staining of Macrophage and Activated Microglia and Astrocyte\\n\\nThe brain and heart samples were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde overnight, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5‐μm thick sections. The samples were incubated with blocking solution for 30 minutes, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies. For assessment of macrophage in the white matter and myocardial muscle, the samples were immunostained with anti‐ED‐1 antibody (working dilution 1:500; BMA Biomedicals AG), as described.15 Positive staining was detected using horseradish peroxidase—conjugated secondary antibodies (Nichirei) by incubating the sections with diaminobenzidine (DAKO). The number of ED‐1‐positive cells was counted in 4 fields of the bilateral white matter and in 10 fields of the myocardial muscle.\\n\\nFor assessment of activated microglia and activated astrocyte in the white matter, the samples were immunostained with anti‐ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule‐1 (Iba‐1, 1:200; Abcam) and anti‐glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:200), in the same manner described above. All measurements were performed in a blinded fashion and expressed as the mean number of the positive cells/mm2.\\n\\n\\nWestern Blot Analysis\\n\\nOur detailed method was described previously.19 Briefly, protein extracts of brain cortex were subjected to SDS‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electrically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were probed with specific antibodies. The antibodies used were as follows: anti‐occludin (×30000, Life Technologies Co), anti‐p67phox (×1000, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti‐Rac1 (×30000, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc) and anti‐GAPDH (×30000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The intensity of the bands was quantified using Image J (NIH Image analysis software v1.46) in a blinded fashion. In individual samples, each value was corrected for that of GAPDH.\\n\\n\\nMeasurement of Brain Superoxide\\n\\nThe brains, removed from SHRSP, were immediately frozen in Tissue‐Tek OCT embedding medium (Sakura Finetek) and sectioned (8 μm) with a cryostat directly onto chilled microscope slides. Dihydroethidium (DHE; Sigma) was used to evaluate superoxide levels in the brain cortex, white matter, and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in situ, as described.20 DHE fluorescence was visualized by FLUOVIEW FV 1000 (OLYMPUS) using Alexa Fluor 594. DHE fluorescence of the sections from brain cortex, white matter, and PVN was quantified in a blinded fashion, using Lumina Vision version 2.2 analysis software. The mean fluorescence in each group was expressed relative to values obtained for low‐salt group.\\n\\n\\nVessel Ring Preparation and Organ Chamber Experiment\\n\\nIsometric tension studies were performed as previously described.21 All measurements were performed in a blinded fashion. In brief, carotid arteries from SHRSP were cut into 5‐mm rings with special care to preserve the endothelium and mounted in organ baths filled with modified Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4; 121 mmol/L NaCl, 5.9 mmol/L KCl, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/L MgCl2, 1.2 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 15.5 mmol/L NaHCO3, and 11.5 mmol/L d‐glucose) aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37°C. The preparations were attached to a force transducer, and isometric tension was recorded on a polygraph. Vessel rings were precontracted with l‐phenylephrine (10−7 mol/L). After a plateau was attained, the rings were exposed to increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside to obtain cumulative concentration‐response curves.\\n\\n\\nHistological Evaluation of Cardiac Fibrosis\\n\\nHearts were fixed in 4% (wt/vol.) paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with Sirius Red F3BA (0.5% wt/vol. in saturated aqueous picric acid; Aldrich Chemical Company) for the measurement of collagen volume fraction. The positive area of fibrosis per field area was assessed by examining at least 10 fields per rat using Lumina Vision version 2.2 analysis software.\\n\\n\\nOther Analytic Procedures\\n\\nRenal norepinephrine levels were quantified by using the commercial ELISA kit (Labor Diagnostika Nord). Measurement of plasma electrolyte concentrations and plasma renin activity was performed at SRL Inc.\\n\\n\\nStatistical Analysis\\n\\nAll assays and measurements in this study were performed in a blinded fashion. The method of statistical analysis used in each experiment is described in all figure legends. Results were expressed as mean±SEM. The onset of stroke symptom and survival rate were analyzed by the standard Kaplan–Meier analysis with a log rank test and χ2 analysis, using GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows (GraphPad Software). The data on SBP and DBP over 14 consecutive days after RD measured by telemetry, and vascular relaxation were analyzed by 1‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures followed by Bonferroni's post‐hoc test for multiple comparisons. The data on SBP, DBP, HR, and locomotor activity during 24 hours (12‐hour dark period and 12‐hour light period) measured by telemetry were analyzed by 2‐way ANOVA with repeated measures, followed by Bonferroni's post‐hoc test for multiple comparisons. The other normal distribution data were analyzed by 1‐way ANOVA with Bartlett's test for equal variances, followed by Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison test. Otherwise non‐normal distribution data were analyzed by nonparametric test with Kruskal‐Wallis test, followed by Dunn's Multiple Comparison test. In all tests, differences were considered statistically significant at a value of P<0.05.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\n\\nBlood Pressure of Salt‐Loaded SHRSP\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 1, direct BP measurement with telemetry over 14 consecutive days demonstrated that RD and hydralazine treatment slightly reduced SBP and DBP in SHRSP compared with sham group. There was no significant difference in SBP or DBP over 14 consecutive days between RD and hydralazine groups. As shown in Figure 2, no significant difference was noted between RD and hydralazine groups, regarding hourly averaged SBP and DBP during 24 hours (12‐hour dark period and 12‐hour light period). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3, hourly averaged HR and locomotor activity were also comparable between RD and hydralazine groups during 12‐hour dark period and 12‐hour light period, except for the difference in HR during the light period.\\n\\nFigure 1.

Heart rate was significantly influenced by group (P<0.05) and period (P<0.01). Locomotor activity was significantly influenced by period (P<0.01) but not by group.

As shown in Figure 4, a high‐salt diet markedly deteriorated the neurological deficit (P<0.01) and survival rate (P<0.01) of SHRSP compared with a low‐salt diet. Compared with sham operation, RD significantly prevented the onset of neurological deficit (P<0.01) and improved survival rate (P<0.01) of salt‐loaded SHRSP. On the other hand, hydralazine did not significantly prevent the deterioration of neurological deficit and death of salt‐loaded SHRSP, despite comparative blood pressure lowering between hydralazine and RD.\\n\\nFigure 4. Effect of RD on neurological deficit (A) and survival rate (B) in SHRSP. Low‐salt, SHRSP fed a low‐salt (0.3% NaCl) diet; High‐salt, SHRSP fed a high‐salt (8% NaCl) diet. Values are mean±SEM (n=15 in High‐salt; n=19 in Sham; n=13 in RD; n=13 in Hyd; n=5 in Low‐salt). Statistical analysis was performed by the standard Kaplan‐Meier analysis with a log rank test and χ2 analysis. ANOVA indicates analysis of variance; Hyd, SHRSP fed a high‐salt diet and orally given hydralazine; RD, SHRSP fed a high‐salt diet and subjected to bilateral renal denervation; SEM, standard error of the mean; Sham, SHRSP fed a high‐salt diet and subjected to sham operation; SHRSP, stroke‐prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.\\n\\n\\nEffects of RD on Cerebral Blood Flow and White Matter Lesions\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 5A, a high‐salt diet significantly reduced CBF of SHRSP compared with a low‐salt diet (P<0.05). RD significantly suppressed this reduction of CBF in salt‐loaded SHRSP (P<0.05), but sham operation or hydralazine treatment failed to suppress it. As shown in Figure 5B, a high‐salt diet caused marked progression of white matter lesion compared with a low‐salt diet (P<0.01). RD significantly prevented the development of white matter lesions in salt‐loaded SHRSP (P<0.01), while sham operation or hydralazine treatment did not prevent it.\\n\\nFigure 5.

RD significantly reduced this increase in IgG leakage (P<0.05) in salt‐loaded SHRSP, in contrast to no significant attenuation of IgG leakage by sham‐operation or hydralazine. As shown in Figure 6B, Western blot analysis showed that the expression of cerebral occludin was significantly decreased in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP than in a low‐salt‐fed SHRSP (P<0.05). RD, but not sham operation or hydralazine treatment, suppressed this downregulation of occludin in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP (P<0.05).\\n\\nFigure 6.

RD significantly ameliorated the increases in number of ED‐1 positive cells, activated microglia, and activated astrocyte in the brain cortex, white matter, and PVN in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP. On the other hand, neither sham operation nor hydralazine treatment attenuated the increases in these inflammatory cells in cerebral cortex, white matter, and PVN in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP.\\n\\nFigure 7.

RD significantly ameliorated the enhancement of superoxide in cortex (P<0.01), white matter (P<0.01), and PVN (P<0.01) of high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP, while sham operation or hydralazine failed to ameliorate them.\\n\\nFigure 8.

RD significantly ameliorated the increase in cerebral p67phox (P<0.01) and Rac1 (P<0.01) proteins in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP, while sham operation or hydralazine failed to reduce them.\\n\\nFigure 9.

Renal norepinephrine contents in RD group of SHRSP were significantly smaller than those in sham‐operation group (12.5±1.9 ng/g versus 184.0±12.0 ng/g tissue; P<0.01). As shown in Figure 10B, plasma renin activity in RD group of SHRSP was significantly smaller than that in sham‐operated group of SHRSP (P<0.05). RD did not affect plasma sodium, potassium, or chloride concentrations in SHRSP (Table).\\n\\nFigure 10.

RD, but not sham operation or hydralazine, significantly ameliorated the impairment of vascular endothelial function in salt‐loaded SHRSP. There was no significant difference in sodium nitroprusside‐induced endothelium‐independent vascular relaxation among each group (data not shown).\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nAlthough RD significantly reduces BP in patients with resistant hypertension,5,7–9,22 it is unknown whether RD can prevent cerebrovascular events beyond BP‐lowering effect. The major findings of our present work were that RD significantly prevented the onset of stroke and the progression of brain injury in hypertensive rats, and these brain‐protective effects of RD were at least in part, mediated by BP‐independent effects, including attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation, and suppression of BBB disruption. Therefore, our present work provided the first evidence supporting that RD seems to be a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke in hypertension.\\n\\nIn the present study, to determine the effectiveness of RD on stroke in hypertension, we used high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP, since SHRSP is regarded as an established and popular model of hypertensive stroke.12,15,20,23 In agreement with our previous reports,12,15,20,23 high‐salt intake significantly accelerated stroke incidence and brain injury in SHRSP, which is consistent with clinical evidence24–28 that excessive salt intake is an important risk factor for stroke. Of note, RD significantly reduced the incidence of neurological deficit and death in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP, despite the very small BP‐lowering effect of RD in SHRSP. On the other hand, hydralazine treatment with similar small BP‐lowering effect to RD did not significantly prevent stroke in SHRSP. These results demonstrate that the mechanism underlying prevention of stroke by RD in SHRSP is mediated by BP‐independent effect. Furthermore, RD significantly attenuated the decrease in cerebral blood flow and significantly prevented the progression of white matter lesion in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP. On the contrary, hydralazine failed to attenuate these changes induced by high‐salt in SHRSP. These results indicate that RD prevented the disturbance of cerebral blood flow and progression of white matter lesion independently of BP. Furthermore, RD significantly limited disruption of BBB in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP, being accompanied by the suppression of downregulation of occludin,29–30 a key tight junction protein involved in intact BBB function, while hydralazine treatment failed to limit these changes in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP. Therefore, the protective effect of RD against stroke in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP seems to be at least partially mediated by the improvement of cerebral blood flow and inhibition of BBB disruption.\\n\\nIn the present work, it is worthy to note that RD significantly ameliorated the increase in inflammatory cells such as macrophage, and activated microglia and astrocyte in cortex, white matter, and PVN regions in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP, while hydralazine did not attenuate them. These findings imply that RD exerts anti‐inflammatory effects in the brain of SHRSP. Accumulating evidence31–34 supports the notion that oxidative stress and inflammation play a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke and brain injury, through formation of a vicious cycle. Previously, we have reported that antioxidant significantly slows the incidence of stroke in high salt‐loaded SHRSP, and this is associated with attenuation of cerebral inflammation, thereby indicating the critical role of brain oxidative stress in the mechanism of stoke in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP.20 Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of RD on brain oxidative stress in SHRSP. RD, but not hydralazine, significantly reduced oxidative stress in cortex, white matter, and PVN of SHRSP. Furthermore, RD, but not hydralazine, significantly prevented the increase in NADPH oxidase subunits, P67 and Rac1 in SHRSP. These results show that RD attenuated brain oxidative stress beyond BP‐lowering effect. Collectively, our present work supports the notion that the attenuation of brain oxidative stress by RD is involved in the prevention of stroke in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP.\\n\\nA growing body of clinical evidence35–36 and experimental work including SHRSP15,20,23 show that renin‐angiotensin system participates in the pathophysiology of stroke and brain injury. In the present study, plasma renin activity was significantly reduced by RD in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP, indicating the suppression of circulating renin‐angiotensin system by RD. Previously we have found that angiotensin II is directly involved in the progression of stroke in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP.15,20,23 Therefore, not only attenuation of brain oxidative stress but also suppression of circulating renin‐angiotensin system appears to account for the protective effects of RD against stroke and brain injury.\\n\\nThe method of RD used in the present work causes denervation of afferent renal sensory nerves as well as efferent renal sympathetic nerves. Substantial evidence indicates that afferent renal sensory nerves project directly to various areas in the central nervous system involved in the regulation of cardiovascular system.4 Previous experimental studies37–39 show that renal injury such as ischemia, through afferent renal nerve, significantly activates the central sympathetic nervous system, thereby leading to the enhancement of systemic sympathetic nerve activity. Furthermore, patients with chronic renal failure are characterized by the enhancement of muscle sympathetic nerve activity through renal afferent nerves.40–41 Thus, it is proposed that renal afferent nerves are a key regulator of peripheral sympathetic nerve activity as well as the central sympathetic nervous system. Recent clinical studies show that RD significantly attenuates muscle sympathetic nerve activity42 and improves cardiac hypertrophy and function,10 atrial fibrillation,11 glucose intolerance43 in patients with resistant hypertension, thereby supporting the concept that RD can have the benefit in prevention of cardiovascular injury through afferent renal nerve ablation. However, it remains to be determined whether these potential organ protective effects of RD in hypertensive patients are secondary to BP‐lowering or not. In the present work, notably, RD, but not hydralazine, significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac macrophage infiltration, and cardiac fibrosis and also prevented the impairment of vascular endothelial function in high‐salt‐loaded SHRSP. These results suggest that BP‐independent protective effects of RD against stroke and cardiovascular injury observed in the present work might be attributed, at least partially, to the ablation of renal afferent nerves.\\n\\n\\nStudy Limitation\\n\\nThe present work did not allow us to define the direct mechanism underlying brain protection by RD in SHRSP and to determine how various pleiotrophic effects of RD observed in this study are linked to each other. As described above, we have previously shown that renin‐angiotensin system and oxidative stress both are directly involved in the progression of stroke and brain injury in SHRSP, through induction of inflammation, ischemia, and blood–brain barrier disruption.12,15,20,23 Therefore, it is likely that the suppression of oxidative stress and renin‐angiotensin system by RD might be the main mechanisms leading to brain protection (Figure 12). However, further study is required to demonstrate our proposal.\\n\\nFigure 12. Proposed mechanism underlying the protection of stroke and brain injury by renal denervation. BBB indicates blood‐brain barrier; RAS, renin‐angiotensin system; ROS, reactive oxygen species; WM, white matter.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our present work provided the first experimental evidence indicating that RD ameliorated the incidence of stroke and brain injury in hypertensive rats beyond BP‐lowering effect and these brain‐protective effects of RD were attributed to the limitation of vicious cycle of oxidative stress and inflammation and the amelioration of renin‐angiotensin system. Therefore, we propose that RD seems to be a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke in hypertensive patients. However, future clinical study is needed to elucidate our proposal.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Renal Denervation Prevents Stroke and Brain Injury via Attenuation of Oxidative Stress in Hypertensive Rats', 'journal_title': 'Journal of the American Heart Association: Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease'}\n",

Initial reaction rates were measured making use of <italic>in situ</italic> IR reaction monitoring and a kinetic analysis of the reaction was executed. The reaction proved to be first order in oxygen concentration. For substrate and acid concentration, saturation kinetics due to O<sub>2</sub> mass transfer limitation were observed. The occurrence of mass transfer limitation was further confirmed by examining the effect of the stirring rate on the initial reaction rate. Interestingly, the effect of the concentration of the catalyst on the rate shows that higher loadings result in a maximal initial rate, followed initially by a steady decrease and subsequently a rate plateau when the concentration is increased further. Mass transfer limitation and increased concentration of dinuclear catalytically active species rationalizes this hitherto unprecedented rate behavior. Continuous-wave and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance methods were used to characterize the catalytic species present in the solution during the reaction and confirmed the presence of both mono- and dinuclear copper species. Analysis of a diverse substrate scope points towards imine&#x02013;enamine tautomerization as a crucial process in the oxidation reaction.

This produced vast quantities of hazardous waste.<xref rid=\"cit1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref> While Mn<sup>II</sup> and Cr<sup>III</sup> are present as trace elements in the human body as essential nutrients, Cr<sup>VI</sup> is a known carcinogen and exposure to Mn<sup>VII</sup> can lead to &#x02018;manganism&#x02019;, a central nervous system disorder.<xref rid=\"cit2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref> Nowadays these classical oxidants are mostly shunned and a major shift has taken place towards less toxic and sustainable oxidants like peroxides or molecular oxygen preferably in combination with a cheap transition-metal catalyst.<xref rid=\"cit3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref> Recently substantial progress has been made in the development of preparative base metal-catalyzed aerobic oxidation reactions of benzylic alcohols.<xref rid=\"cit4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref> The direct benzylic methylene oxygenation is however far less studied.<xref rid=\"cit5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref> Notable examples using peroxides as the terminal oxidant on active methylenes are reported by the groups of Bolm, Punniyamurthy, Chen and Sasson using respectively FeCl<sub>3</sub>, a Cu<sup>II</sup> Salen-H<sub>4</sub>, a Mn(OAc)<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;4H<sub>2</sub>O complex and CuCl<sub>2</sub> as the catalyst.<xref rid=\"cit6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>,<xref rid=\"cit7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref> Methylene oxidations using copper and iron with molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant are of special interest. After all, these metals are abundant, feature a low toxicity, and oxygen is the most sustainable oxidant on earth.<xref rid=\"cit8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> There is a great number of important articles available on the structure and reactivity of various Cu- and, to a lesser degree, Fe-complexes with molecular oxygen.<xref rid=\"cit9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> The stoichiometric study of these complexes provides a simplified mimic of the active site of several important metalloproteins (for instance: tyrosinase, dopamine &#x003b2;-monooxygenase, galactose oxidase or cytochrome P450) and are therefore easier to study. These complexes are usually very well defined and are formed by reaction of a reduced metal center (Cu<sup>I</sup> and Fe<sup>II</sup>) with O<sub>2</sub> to form the reactive intermediate, which reacts directly with the substrate. Alternatively, they can also be formed by using metals in a higher oxidation state (Cu<sup>II</sup> and Fe<sup>III</sup>) in combination with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. A stabilizing nitrogen-containing ligand (bidentate or higher) is a prerequisite for these systems to be stable enough to be studied. Furthermore the ligand provides a mimic of the polypeptide chain around the metal center and can be used to tune the reactivity of the complex.</p><p>In comparison to the reports describing well characterized model complexes in stoichiometric reactions, preparative protocols for oxygenation of active methylenes involving <italic>in situ</italic> formed copper and iron catalysts with oxygen as the stoichiometric oxidant are still limited.<xref rid=\"cit10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>,<xref rid=\"cit11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> In 2012 our group published a communication describing a synthetic protocol for the copper- and iron-catalyzed oxidation of the methylene group of aryl(di)azinylmethanes with acetic acid as promoter (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"sch1\">Scheme 1</xref>).<xref rid=\"cit11a\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11<italic>a</italic></xref></p><fig id=\"sch1\" fig-type=\"scheme\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><title>Oxidation of model substrate 2-benzylpyridine (<bold>1</bold>) to 2-benzoylpyridine (<bold>2</bold>) under the standard reaction conditions.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"c5sc03530a-s1\"/></fig><p>Several groups have made creative use of these reaction conditions and some extended them to other substrate systems. Kappe successfully translated our protocol into an efficient flow process allowing scale up and continuous production.<xref rid=\"cit12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref> By slightly modifying our disclosed reaction conditions Tour&#x000e9; achieved selective oxidation of C&#x02013;H bonds in drug candidates and APIs delivering drug metabolites. The oxidation protocol could also be applied to oxygenate carbons alpha to a tertiary amine and therefore mimic or complement cytochrome P450.<xref rid=\"cit13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref> Very recently Zhuo and Lei disclosed a similar oxidation protocol in which ethyl chloroacetate was used as a promoter instead of acetic acid.<xref rid=\"cit14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> A final interesting and notable example of an extension towards other functionalizations is the copper-catalyzed &#x003b1;-methylenation of benzylpyridines using DMA as a one-carbon source.<xref rid=\"cit15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> When Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> was used as an oxidant instead of O<sub>2</sub>, chemoselective methylation occurred over oxygenation of the methylene. Although there are several publications describing preparative methylene oxidation protocols based on copper or iron and O<sub>2</sub>, no detailed mechanistic studies (involving kinetics) have been performed yet to support the proposed catalytic cycles. As copper and iron salts easily form polynuclear species, the nature of the catalyst in these reactions remains also unknown. To allow further developments in this field, knowledge of the catalytically active species and the catalytic cycle is crucial. In this paper we disclose the results of mechanistic studies on the oxidation of 2-benzylpyridine under copper catalysis with oxygen as oxidant as model system (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"sch1\">Scheme 1</xref>), leading to an insight into the actual reaction mechanism of this intriguing transformation. DMSO was chosen as the solvent for this mechanistic study to avoid solubility problems considering the large ranges of concentrations of the different reaction components that had to be used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Substrate scope: structural requirements</title><p>The previously developed reaction conditions (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"sch1\">Scheme 1</xref>) allowed to oxidize 2- (<bold>1</bold>) and 4-benzylpyridine (<bold>6</bold>), while no oxidation of 3-benzylpyridine (<bold>4</bold>) and diphenylmethane (<bold>8</bold>) occurred.<xref rid=\"cit11a\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11<italic>a</italic></xref> From this was concluded that the oxidation is not a directed reaction since coordination of the metal catalyst to the nitrogen in 4-benzylpyridine would bring the metal too far away from the benzylic position to promote an intramolecular reaction. Instead, these observations point to an imine&#x02013;enamine tautomerization as a prerequisite for the reaction to proceed. Besides, the acidity of the methylene protons is also important since 2-methylpyridine (<bold>10</bold>) could not be oxidized. Further support that a combination of these two factors is necessary was gathered by performing experiments on a selected set of substrates (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref>). When the acidity of the methylene in <bold>10</bold> is increased by introducing an electron-withdrawing group, either on the pyridine ring or on the methylene group, the substrate can be oxidized again as exemplified by methyl 2-(pyridin-2-yl)acetate (<bold>14</bold>) and 6-methylnicotinonitrile (<bold>12</bold>). A control experiment with methyl 2-phenylacetate (<bold>16</bold>) proves that the imine moiety is still necessary and that activation by the methyl ester alone is not sufficient for this reaction to proceed. To test whether this oxidation protocol can also be used beyond azine type systems it was applied to azoles; 2-benzyl-1-methyl-1<italic>H</italic>-imidazole (<bold>18</bold>) and 1,2-dimethylimidazole (<bold>20</bold>). The phenyl-activating group appears to still be a necessary structural element since we were only able to oxygenate the former substrate, similarly to what has been observed for <bold>10</bold>. Other 2-benzylazoles can also be used, as shown by the oxidation of 2-benzylbenzoxazole (<bold>22</bold>) and 2-benzylbenzothiazole (<bold>24</bold>), further underlining the general applicability of the oxidation method.</p><table-wrap id=\"tab1\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Calculated p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> values and Cu-catalyzed

suitable for oxidation under our protocol (<italic>vide supra</italic>) indicated that the mechanism of the oxidation seems to revolve around an (initial) imine&#x02013;enamine tautomerization. The imine&#x02013;enamine tautomerization can be thermodynamically quantified by an equilibrium constant <italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Fig. 1</xref>). To gain more insight in these tautomerizations, the p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> values for the different experimentally tested substrates were calculated using density functional theory (DFT, <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig id=\"fig1\" fig-type=\"figure\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Imine&#x02013;enamine equilibrium of 2- and 4-benzylpyridine.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"c5sc03530a-f1\"/></fig><p>First, the geometries of the different conformations of both the imine- and the enamine-form were optimized at the B3PW91/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. Due to the rather large dipole moment of the molecules and the difference in dipole moment of the imine and the respective enamine tautomer (Table S5<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>), the self-consistent reaction field (scrf) model was used to account for solvent&#x02013;solute interactions with DMSO. In a second phase, the most stable imine and respective enamine conformer were used to calculate the Gibbs free energy (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic>&#x000b0;) and the desired equilibrium constant <italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> (see ESI<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref> for more details). All calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 program. In <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref> the results of these calculations for the different experimentally tested benzylic systems are summarized. These calculated values do not have a direct absolute meaning but can be compared relatively between different substrates.</p><p>Benzylpyridines (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>6</bold>) have a p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> value of 11.5 and 11.0, respectively, which is up to 9 orders of magnitude lower than 3-benzylpyridine (<bold>4</bold>), with a p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> value of 20.4. This is because in 3-benzylpyridine stabilization by an enamine tautomeric form is not possible, as is also the case for diphenylmethane (<bold>8</bold>). Furthermore, without the second aromatic ring attached to the methylene center the p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> rises with about 4 orders of magnitude, as exemplified by 2-methylpyridine (<bold>10</bold>). Introducing an electron withdrawing group either on the pyridine or on the methylene moiety results in a higher equilibrium constant (<bold>12</bold> and <bold>14</bold>). Although a keto&#x02013;enol tautomerization can be drawn for the methylester functionality of methyl 2-phenylacetate (<bold>16</bold>) it still provides a relatively high p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> value (18.8) (see Table S4<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref> for more details on the tautomerization equilibria).</p><p>Interestingly, from <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref>, a clear correlation exists between the calculated p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> values and whether oxidation occurs or not for each substrate. Only the substrates with a sufficiently low p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> or high <italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> value are reactive enough to be oxidized. Empirically, based on <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref> and the p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> values calculated for substrates previously published, one can deduce the maximum p<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> value for the reaction to proceed under our standard reaction conditions to be around 15.</p><p>Homolytic benzylic C&#x02013;H bond dissociation energies (BDE) of the molecules in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab1\">Table 1</xref> were also calculated (see Table S6<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>). If a correlation exists this would be an indication for a mechanism in which the active catalyst abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate before quenching with O<sub>2</sub>. However, no correlation could be found since the bond dissociation energies of diphenylmethane (<bold>8</bold>), 2-, 3-, and 4-benzylpyridine (<bold>1</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, and <bold>6</bold>) are similar while there is a major difference in their reactivity in our oxidation protocol. DFT calculations thus provide an interesting qualitative tool to predict whether or not a substrate will be viable for oxygenation under our reaction conditions and strongly suggest that the oxidation reaction proceeds <italic>via</italic> the enamine tautomer as the reactive species.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetic experiments</title><p>In the oxidation reaction of <bold>1</bold>, small amounts of phenyl(pyridin-2-yl)methanol (<bold>3</bold>) were observed besides the desired 2-benzoylpyridine (<bold>2</bold>).<xref rid=\"cit11a\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11<italic>a</italic></xref> This raised the question whether formation of the 2-benzoylpyridine (<bold>2</bold>) proceeds <italic>via</italic> phenyl(pyridin-2-yl)methanol (<bold>3</bold>) as an intermediate (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Fig. 2</xref>, pathway 1a/1b) or <italic>via</italic> a pathway directly from 2-benzylpyridine (<bold>1</bold>) (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Fig. 2</xref>, pathway 2), in which case the alcohol is merely a formed side product.</p><fig id=\"fig2\" fig-type=\"figure\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Two possible reaction pathways in the oxidation of <bold>1</bold>.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"c5sc03530a-f2\"/></fig><p>As &#x003b2;-hydride elimination of copper alkoxide complexes is known but rare, we first tested whether alcohol <bold>3</bold> could be oxidized under our reaction conditions.<xref rid=\"cit16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> When the optimal reaction conditions were applied (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"sch2\">Scheme 2</xref>), ketone <bold>2</bold> was isolated in 77% yield with 12% recovery of <bold>3</bold>.</p><fig id=\"sch2\" fig-type=\"scheme\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Scheme 2</label><caption><title>Copper-catalyzed oxidation reaction of <bold>3</bold> under standard conditions.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"c5sc03530a-s2\"/></fig><p>To gain more insight we performed a kinetic study using <italic>in situ</italic> IR monitoring.

For each of these transformations the results were compared to a similar reaction where 1 equivalent of the radical scavenger 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) was added to the reaction mixture. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Fig. 3</xref> (left) shows that the presence of TEMPO has almost no influence on the formation of ketone <bold>2</bold>, starting from <bold>1</bold>. However, the oxidation of alcohol <bold>3</bold> is significantly accelerated in the presence of the radical scavenger (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Fig. 3</xref>, right). Stahl already reported that smooth oxidation of alcohols can be achieved by the use of a radical catalyst, such as TEMPO, in combination with a copper catalyst and oxygen as the stoichiometric oxidant, which accounts for these observations.<xref rid=\"cit17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref> Assuming that the reaction proceeds exclusively <italic>via</italic> pathway 1a/1b the first step (1a) should be rate determining to account for a benzylic oxidation in <bold>1</bold> to ketone <bold>2</bold> which is not influenced by a radical scavenger, while the oxidation of alcohol <bold>3</bold> (pathway 1b) to the same product is significantly accelerated by its addition. Contradictorily, a comparison between the initial rate of oxidation of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, shows that the oxidation of the latter is in fact slower than the oxidation of the former. On the other hand, if the second step (pathway 1b) would be rate determining, one expects a build-up of alcohol in the reaction mixture. This is not the case since only small amounts are present during the reaction course (<italic>vide supra</italic>). These contradictions imply that an indirect pathway 1a/1b can be excluded and our reaction proceeds <italic>via</italic> a direct pathway 2 with the formation of <bold>3</bold> as side compound.

When higher concentrations are used the reaction approaches zeroth order for the acid and <bold>1</bold> concentrations. This saturation behavior with <italic>v</italic><sub>max</sub> at approximately 1.2 mM min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> is due to the occurrence of O<sub>2</sub> mass transfer limitation conditions as was the case for the stirring experiments (<italic>vide supra</italic>).<xref rid=\"cit20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref> The measured data points are in accordance with hyperbolic functions (see ESI<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref> for derivations).

After all, when the concentration of these three components was raised simultaneously, thereby keeping their respective ratios constant, the initial rate again showed the same <italic>v</italic><sub>max</sub> value (Fig. S16<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>).</p><p>The dependence of the reaction rate on the catalyst concentration follows a more complex pattern. At very low catalyst concentrations the rate increases very fast in a hyperbolic fashion. At a rate of 1.2 mM min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> it also reaches a maximum and after that the reaction rate becomes invariant of the catalyst concentration. The value of this maximum is determined by the O<sub>2</sub> mass transfer limitation and corresponds to the <italic>v</italic><sub>max</sub> that was observed for [AcOH] and [<bold>1</bold>]. However, when the catalyst loading is further increased, the reaction rate diminishes significantly (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Fig. 5</xref>, lower left) to finally settle at a constant rate independent of the catalyst concentration. As the occurrence of mass transfer limitation would result in a hyperbolic curve approaching 1.2 mM min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> as <italic>v</italic><sub>max</sub>, the significant drop in initial rate cannot be explained by the occurrence of mass transfer limitation and another factor has to be taken into account. Other examples of non-linear dependence on [catalyst] for aerobic oxidations have previously been reported by the groups of Stahl and Sheldon.<xref rid=\"cit17b\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17b</xref>,<xref rid=\"cit21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref> We attribute the continuous drop in rate to the existence of dinuclear Cu-species. Trapping the active catalyst in a dinuclear species can inhibit the reaction since adding more catalyst will only result in the formation of more dimer <italic>via</italic> a second order process in [catalyst]. The non-zero reaction rate at very high catalyst loadings can only be explained by considering that these dinuclear species are also catalytically active (rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>d</sub>), however substantially less reactive than the mononuclear species (rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>m</sub>) (<italic>k</italic><sub>m</sub> &#x0003e; <italic>k</italic><sub>d</sub>). This is interesting as usually non-reactive dinuclear complexes are considered. A rate law (eqn (1)) was derived (see ESI<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>) which takes into account reactive di-nuclear complexes but no mass transfer limitation.<xref rid=\"cit22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref> A very good fit could be obtained for the data points before and after mass transfer limitation (dashed line).

The field area specific for mononuclear Cu<sup>II</sup> complexes is shown for the spectra recorded at 100 K. None of the EPR spectra showed signals typical of organic radicals. Instead, a clear evolution of mononuclear Cu<sup>II</sup> complexes is observed in function of the reaction time, with different species contributing to the spectra, as is best visible in the low-field range (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Fig. 6B</xref>). At short reaction times (5 and 10 min), the EPR spectra revealed two species, labeled III and IV, with the contribution of III decreasing over time. After 1 h, only component IV is left and as the reaction progresses, a contribution of a new species V starts to emerge. The EPR parameters of species IV are slightly changing with time (species IV&#x02032;), which may be related to changes in the direct neighborhood of the complex. The EPR spectrum of species III can be obtained by a weighted subtraction of the spectra recorded after 5 and 10 minutes (bottom spectrum in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Fig. 6A</xref>). In the high-field region, clearly resolved hyperfine couplings are visible that can be satisfactorily simulated considering the interaction of the unpaired electron with the copper nucleus and with two <sup>14</sup>N surrounding nuclei. The hyperfine coupling of the latter interaction (40 MHz) is similar to that obtained for the hyperfine value of the pyridine nitrogen nuclei in Cu(py)<sub>4</sub> complexes.<xref rid=\"cit32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref> Given that species III is observed at an early stage of the reaction it can be ascribed to an initial complexation of the copper ion with two 2-benzylpyridine (<bold>1</bold>) molecules, [Cu(DMSO)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>(<bold>1</bold>)<sub>2</sub>]Y<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Fig. 6</xref>), where <italic>n</italic> = 2, 3 or 4 and Y = <sup>&#x02013;</sup>OH, <sup>&#x02013;</sup>I or <sup>&#x02013;</sup>OAc. Moreover, when the same reaction is carried out in toluene instead of DMSO, the CW-EPR signal after 5 minutes reaction (Fig. S12<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>) shows only species with <italic>g</italic> and <italic>A</italic> parameters similar to species IV (see Table S3<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>), without contribution from DMSO-related species III. The EPR parameters of species IV are very close to those reported for a powder of Cu(O<sub>2</sub>CCPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;2py and for a frozen solution of CaCu(OAc)<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O in pyridine.<xref rid=\"cit33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>,<xref rid=\"cit34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref> Addition of pyridine to dinuclear copper carboxylates has been shown to yield dinuclear complexes in equilibrium with mononuclear species of the form Cu(O<sub>2</sub>CR)<sub>2</sub>py<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid=\"cit31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref> The structure of IV can therefore be assigned to Cu(OAc)<sub>2</sub>(<bold>1</bold>)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Fig. 6</xref>).

However, here the contribution of species III dominates the EPR spectrum even after 4 h of reaction (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab2\">Table 2</xref>, entries 7 and 8, spectrum not shown), while it disappears within the first hour in the reaction mixture with a 0.05 M copper concentration (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab2\">Table 2</xref>, entries 3&#x02013;6). This can be rationalized when considering that the Cu(OAc)<sub>2</sub>(<bold>1</bold>)<sub>2</sub> complex (IV) is readily formed for high [<bold>1</bold>]/[Cu<sup>II</sup>] and [AcOH]/[Cu<sup>II</sup>] ratios, as is the case for our standard reaction conditions. However, when the copper concentration is increased, the relative amount of acetate per copper is lower and mononuclear copper complexes involving <bold>1</bold> and/or DMSO with I<sup>&#x02013;</sup> or HO<sup>&#x02013;</sup> as anions, instead of <bold>1</bold> and acetate may be formed at higher relative quantities.</p><p>Complex V is only resolved in the EPR spectra of the reaction mixture with low copper content after a longer (4 h) reaction time (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab2\">Table 2</xref>, entry 6, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Fig. 6B</xref>). Since the [<bold>2</bold>]/[Cu<sup>II</sup>] ratio can already be significant at this stage of the reaction, the ligation of <bold>2</bold> to the copper complex becomes competitive. In the reaction with high copper content, the [<bold>2</bold>] may be too small for the complex to be formed. Unfortunately, the copper amount was too high at this stage of the reaction for both mixtures to allow for pulsed EPR analyses to verify this possibility (too fast electronic relaxations). However, CW-EPR spectra recorded of a reference mixture of CuI, AcOH and ketone <bold>2</bold> revealed the presence of a type-V species (see ESI, Fig. S6&#x02013;S7<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>) supporting our hypothesis.

Again, none of the spectra show contributions of organic radicals, confirming the low-temperature EPR results and the kinetic experiments using radical scavengers. In line with the low-temperature EPR (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Fig. 6</xref> and S5<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>), a significant variation of the EPR spectrum can be seen during the course of the reaction involving a lower copper loading due to contributions of species III and IV (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Fig. 8</xref>), whereas a negligible variation is seen when a higher amount of copper is used (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig9\">Fig. 9</xref>) (see also detailed comparison in ESI, Fig. S8 and S9<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>). Comparison of the latter spectra with the EPR spectrum of the solution without substrate <bold>1</bold> (bottom <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig9\">Fig. 9</xref>) suggests a strong contribution of Cu<sup>II</sup> complexes that are related to species I and II.

This is not due to the absence of the dimers, but is simply due to spectral broadening effects as reported earlier by others for dinuclear copper acetate species.<xref rid=\"cit38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref> Large Cu<sup>II</sup> concentrations are required to be able to observe the typical EPR features stemming from dinuclear copper species at room temperature (Fig. S11,<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref> signals indicated with arrows). The amount of dinuclear species is clearly increasing during the reaction time. Furthermore, the signal change at a later stage of the experiment (see for instance the appearance of a peak around 480 mT) is indicative of variation in the types of dinuclear complexes that are formed under these circumstances.

Further proof for these acetate bridged dinuclear Cu<sup>II</sup> species was obtained using infrared spectroscopy.

These results confirm that in accordance with our mechanistic proposal for each molecule of product one molecule of water is formed and that no extra oxygen is required to oxidize the catalyst during the catalytic cycle.</p><p>For our proposed catalytic cycle a kinetic isotope effect is expected even though C&#x02013;H/D bond cleavage is not included in the rate-determining step. As the C&#x02013;H bond cleavage (<italic>via</italic> imine&#x02013;enamine tautomerization) is reversible and its <italic>k</italic><sub>&#x02013;1</sub> is much faster than the <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> of the RDS (oxygenation), the observed KIE is the equilibrium isotope effect.<xref rid=\"cit44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref> When comparing the initial rates of the reaction on <bold>1</bold> using AcOH with that of <bold>1</bold>-d<sub>2</sub> using AcOD-d<sub>4</sub> a KIE value of 4.28 was found (Fig. S19<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>).

When mixing 2-benzylpyridine with d<sub>4</sub>-AcOD in deuterated DMSO in the absence of catalyst and O<sub>2</sub> the singlet of the benzylic protons started to disappear in <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and a broad triplet resulting from <bold>1</bold>-d<sub>1</sub> started to appear further supporting the imine&#x02013;enamine tautomerization (see ESI Fig. S20<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\">&#x02020;</xref>). In contrast, diphenylmethane (<bold>8</bold>) could not be deuterated in the same manner as expected.</p><p>The EPR experiments (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab2\">Table 2</xref>) indicate that the catalyst resting state is species <bold>IV</bold> with even at low [catalyst] a significant contribution of dinuclear species <bold>VI</bold>. When the [catalyst] is increased the equilibrium is significantly shifted towards the dinuclear species <bold>VI</bold>. Because the equilibrium between the imine (<bold>1</bold>) and enamine (<bold>A</bold>) tautomers is highly shifted towards the imine (<bold>1</bold>) the concentration of species <bold>B</bold> and <bold>B&#x02032;</bold> is expected to be very low which explains why these species were never directly observed by EPR measurements. The reason why the dinuclear species oxidize slower than the mononuclear is unclear. The simplest explanation is the increased steric bulk of the catalyst (4 bridging acetates). However it is also possible that the second Cu<sup>II</sup> in <bold>C&#x02032;</bold> reacts with the formed Cu<sup>III</sup>-superoxide species producing a less reactive dioxygen bridged species.</p><p>Formation of side product <bold>3</bold> can occur <italic>via</italic> protonation of intermediate <bold>D</bold> or <bold>D&#x02032;</bold> producing a hydroperoxide that can undergo a Fenton like Cu<sup>I</sup>-catalyzed homolytical cleavage of the O&#x02013;O bond yielding alcohol <bold>3</bold> and a hydroxyl radical.

Although the mechanism of Cu-catalyzed aerobic alcohol oxidation has been thoroughly studied, kinetic studies on the corresponding methylene oxidation are unprecedented. Only reactions on stoichiometric Cu-complexes with oxygen have been reported. In this study we have shown that the substrates are activated <italic>via</italic> an initial acid catalyzed imine&#x02013;enamine tautomerization. DFT calculations can be used as useful method to predict the equilibrium constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub>) and can act as a tool to qualitatively predict whether or not a substrate can be oxidized. Alcohol <bold>3</bold> was excluded as an intermediate in this reaction and is a side product presumably generated by the homolytical breaking of the O&#x02013;O bond in the hydroperoxide formed from complex <bold>D</bold>/<bold>D&#x02032;</bold><italic>via</italic> protonation. Kinetic studies revealed O<sub>2</sub> mass transfer limitation effects limiting the turnover of the reaction at high concentrations of substrate and acetic acid. A complex kinetic behavior was observed when increasing the catalyst loading. At intermediate loadings mass transfer is again occurring resulting in a maximum rate. The continued decrease of the reaction rate at higher concentrations of catalyst however can\\'t be explained by the occurrence of mass transfer alone. When using transition metal catalysis in combination with (acetate) bridging ligands dinuclear species need to be considered. Although these are usually considered to be related to catalyst deactivation this study shows this is not necessarily the case as they explain the further reduction in rate observed at a higher concentration than at which the mass transfer determined <italic>v</italic><sub>max</sub> occurs. The formation of a dinuclear catalytically active species which is less reactive than the mononuclear catalyst explains the non-zero reaction rate at increased concentration of added catalyst. Such behavior is to the best of our knowledge unprecedented in literature. In addition to these kinetic experiments we performed an in-depth EPR-study to characterize the catalytic species present in the reaction. These measurements confirmed the presence of both different mono- and dinuclear Cu<sup>II</sup>-species. The results presented in this paper can directly be used in the mechanistic study of other active methylene oxygenations where the methylene moiety is activated by a tautomerization step.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"supplementary-material\"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"S1\"><alt-text>Supplementary information</alt-text><media xlink:href=\"SC-007-C5SC03530A-s001.pdf\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO-Flanders), the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT-Flanders), the University of Antwerp (BOF, IOF) and the Hercules Foundation.

This produced vast quantities of hazardous waste.1 While MnII and CrIII are present as trace elements in the human body as essential nutrients, CrVI is a known carcinogen and exposure to MnVII can lead to ‘manganism’, a central nervous system disorder.2 Nowadays these classical oxidants are mostly shunned and a major shift has taken place towards less toxic and sustainable oxidants like peroxides or molecular oxygen preferably in combination with a cheap transition-metal catalyst.3 Recently substantial progress has been made in the development of preparative base metal-catalyzed aerobic oxidation reactions of benzylic alcohols.4 The direct benzylic methylene oxygenation is however far less studied.5 Notable examples using peroxides as the terminal oxidant on active methylenes are reported by the groups of Bolm, Punniyamurthy, Chen and Sasson using respectively FeCl3, a CuII Salen-H4, a Mn(OAc)2·4H2O complex and CuCl2 as the catalyst.6,7 Methylene oxidations using copper and iron with molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant are of special interest. After all, these metals are abundant, feature a low toxicity, and oxygen is the most sustainable oxidant on earth.8 There is a great number of important articles available on the structure and reactivity of various Cu- and, to a lesser degree, Fe-complexes with molecular oxygen.9 The stoichiometric study of these complexes provides a simplified mimic of the active site of several important metalloproteins (for instance: tyrosinase, dopamine β-monooxygenase, galactose oxidase or cytochrome P450) and are therefore easier to study. These complexes are usually very well defined and are formed by reaction of a reduced metal center (CuI and FeII) with O2 to form the reactive intermediate, which reacts directly with the substrate. Alternatively, they can also be formed by using metals in a higher oxidation state (CuII and FeIII) in combination with H2O2. A stabilizing nitrogen-containing ligand (bidentate or higher) is a prerequisite for these systems to be stable enough to be studied. Furthermore the ligand provides a mimic of the polypeptide chain around the metal center and can be used to tune the reactivity of the complex.\\n\\nIn comparison to the reports describing well characterized model complexes in stoichiometric reactions, preparative protocols for oxygenation of active methylenes involving in situ formed copper and iron catalysts with oxygen as the stoichiometric oxidant are still limited.10,11 In 2012 our group published a communication describing a synthetic protocol for the copper- and iron-catalyzed oxidation of the methylene group of aryl(di)azinylmethanes with acetic acid as promoter (Scheme 1).11a\\n\\nScheme 1 Oxidation of model substrate 2-benzylpyridine (1) to 2-benzoylpyridine (2) under the standard reaction conditions.\\n\\nSeveral groups have made creative use of these reaction conditions and some extended them to other substrate systems. Kappe successfully translated our protocol into an efficient flow process allowing scale up and continuous production.12 By slightly modifying our disclosed reaction conditions Touré achieved selective oxidation of C–H bonds in drug candidates and APIs delivering drug metabolites. The oxidation protocol could also be applied to oxygenate carbons alpha to a tertiary amine and therefore mimic or complement cytochrome P450.13 Very recently Zhuo and Lei disclosed a similar oxidation protocol in which ethyl chloroacetate was used as a promoter instead of acetic acid.14 A final interesting and notable example of an extension towards other functionalizations is the copper-catalyzed α-methylenation of benzylpyridines using DMA as a one-carbon source.15 When Na2S2O8 was used as an oxidant instead of O2, chemoselective methylation occurred over oxygenation of the methylene. Although there are several publications describing preparative methylene oxidation protocols based on copper or iron and O2, no detailed mechanistic studies (involving kinetics) have been performed yet to support the proposed catalytic cycles. As copper and iron salts easily form polynuclear species, the nature of the catalyst in these reactions remains also unknown. To allow further developments in this field, knowledge of the catalytically active species and the catalytic cycle is crucial. In this paper we disclose the results of mechanistic studies on the oxidation of 2-benzylpyridine under copper catalysis with oxygen as oxidant as model system (Scheme 1), leading to an insight into the actual reaction mechanism of this intriguing transformation. DMSO was chosen as the solvent for this mechanistic study to avoid solubility problems considering the large ranges of concentrations of the different reaction components that had to be used.\\n\\n\\nResults and discussion\\n\\n\\nSubstrate scope: structural requirements\\n\\nThe previously developed reaction conditions (Scheme 1) allowed to oxidize 2- (1) and 4-benzylpyridine (6), while no oxidation of 3-benzylpyridine (4) and diphenylmethane (8) occurred.11a From this was concluded that the oxidation is not a directed reaction since coordination of the metal catalyst to the nitrogen in 4-benzylpyridine would bring the metal too far away from the benzylic position to promote an intramolecular reaction. Instead, these observations point to an imine–enamine tautomerization as a prerequisite for the reaction to proceed. Besides, the acidity of the methylene protons is also important since 2-methylpyridine (10) could not be oxidized. Further support that a combination of these two factors is necessary was gathered by performing experiments on a selected set of substrates (Table 1). When the acidity of the methylene in 10 is increased by introducing an electron-withdrawing group, either on the pyridine ring or on the methylene group, the substrate can be oxidized again as exemplified by methyl 2-(pyridin-2-yl)acetate (14) and 6-methylnicotinonitrile (12). A control experiment with methyl 2-phenylacetate (16) proves that the imine moiety is still necessary and that activation by the methyl ester alone is not sufficient for this reaction to proceed. To test whether this oxidation protocol can also be used beyond azine type systems it was applied to azoles; 2-benzyl-1-methyl-1H-imidazole (18) and 1,2-dimethylimidazole (20). The phenyl-activating group appears to still be a necessary structural element since we were only able to oxygenate the former substrate, similarly to what has been observed for 10. Other 2-benzylazoles can also be used, as shown by the oxidation of 2-benzylbenzoxazole (22) and 2-benzylbenzothiazole (24), further underlining the general applicability of the oxidation method.\\n\\nTable 1\\nEntry\\tSubstrate\\tProduct\\tp\\tYield\\n1\\t11.5\\t92\\n2\\t20.4\\t0\\n3\\t11.0\\t89\\n4\\t21.7\\t0\\n5\\t15.9\\t0\\n6\\t13.0\\t27 (60)\\n7\\t6.2\\t23 (83)\\n8\\t18.8\\t0\\n9\\t13.9\\t34 (85)\\n10\\t19.0\\t0\\n11\\t9.1\\t98\\n12\\t8.1\\t99\\n\\n\\nImine–enamine tautomerization: computational study\\n\\nThe structural features of substrates suitable for oxidation under our protocol (vide supra) indicated that the mechanism of the oxidation seems to revolve around an (initial) imine–enamine tautomerization. The imine–enamine tautomerization can be thermodynamically quantified by an equilibrium constant Keq (Fig. 1). To gain more insight in these tautomerizations, the pKeq values for the different experimentally tested substrates were calculated using density functional theory (DFT, Table 1).\\n\\nFig. 1 Imine–enamine equilibrium of 2- and 4-benzylpyridine.\\n\\nFirst, the geometries of the different conformations of both the imine- and the enamine-form were optimized at the B3PW91/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. Due to the rather large dipole moment of the molecules and the difference in dipole moment of the imine and the respective enamine tautomer (Table S5†), the self-consistent reaction field (scrf) model was used to account for solvent–solute interactions with DMSO. In a second phase, the most stable imine and respective enamine conformer were used to calculate the Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) and the desired equilibrium constant Keq (see ESI† for more details). All calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 program. In Table 1 the results of these calculations for the different experimentally tested benzylic systems are summarized. These calculated values do not have a direct absolute meaning but can be compared relatively between different substrates.\\n\\nBenzylpyridines (1 and 6) have a pKeq value of 11.5 and 11.0, respectively, which is up to 9 orders of magnitude lower than 3-benzylpyridine (4), with a pKeq value of 20.4. This is because in 3-benzylpyridine stabilization by an enamine tautomeric form is not possible, as is also the case for diphenylmethane (8). Furthermore, without the second aromatic ring attached to the methylene center the pKeq rises with about 4 orders of magnitude, as exemplified by 2-methylpyridine (10). Introducing an electron withdrawing group either on the pyridine or on the methylene moiety results in a higher equilibrium constant (12 and 14). Although a keto–enol tautomerization can be drawn for the methylester functionality of methyl 2-phenylacetate (16) it still provides a relatively high pKeq value (18.8) (see Table S4† for more details on the tautomerization equilibria).\\n\\nInterestingly, from Table 1, a clear correlation exists between the calculated pKeq values and whether oxidation occurs or not for each substrate. Only the substrates with a sufficiently low pKeq or high Keq value are reactive enough to be oxidized. Empirically, based on Table 1 and the pKeq values calculated for substrates previously published, one can deduce the maximum pKeq value for the reaction to proceed under our standard reaction conditions to be around 15.\\n\\nHomolytic benzylic C–H bond dissociation energies (BDE) of the molecules in Table 1 were also calculated (see Table S6†). If a correlation exists this would be an indication for a mechanism in which the active catalyst abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate before quenching with O2. However, no correlation could be found since the bond dissociation energies of diphenylmethane (8), 2-, 3-, and 4-benzylpyridine (1, 4, and 6) are similar while there is a major difference in their reactivity in our oxidation protocol. DFT calculations thus provide an interesting qualitative tool to predict whether or not a substrate will be viable for oxygenation under our reaction conditions and strongly suggest that the oxidation reaction proceeds via the enamine tautomer as the reactive species.\\n\\n\\nKinetic experiments\\n\\nIn the oxidation reaction of 1, small amounts of phenyl(pyridin-2-yl)methanol (3) were observed besides the desired 2-benzoylpyridine (2).11a This raised the question whether formation of the 2-benzoylpyridine (2) proceeds via phenyl(pyridin-2-yl)methanol (3) as an intermediate (Fig. 2, pathway 1a/1b) or via a pathway directly from 2-benzylpyridine (1) (Fig. 2, pathway 2), in which case the alcohol is merely a formed side product.\\n\\nFig. 2 Two possible reaction pathways in the oxidation of 1.\\n\\nAs β-hydride elimination of copper alkoxide complexes is known but rare, we first tested whether alcohol 3 could be oxidized under our reaction conditions.16 When the optimal reaction conditions were applied (Scheme 2), ketone 2 was isolated in 77% yield with 12% recovery of 3.\\n\\nScheme 2 Copper-catalyzed oxidation reaction of 3 under standard conditions.\\n\\nTo gain more insight we performed a kinetic study using in situ IR monitoring. The concentration of ketone 2 was monitored over time (CO stretch frequency) and the initial reaction rate was determined. Both the oxidation of 1 and 3 (Fig. 3) were followed in function of time. For each of these transformations the results were compared to a similar reaction where 1 equivalent of the radical scavenger 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) was added to the reaction mixture. Fig. 3 (left) shows that the presence of TEMPO has almost no influence on the formation of ketone 2, starting from 1. However, the oxidation of alcohol 3 is significantly accelerated in the presence of the radical scavenger (Fig. 3, right). Stahl already reported that smooth oxidation of alcohols can be achieved by the use of a radical catalyst, such as TEMPO, in combination with a copper catalyst and oxygen as the stoichiometric oxidant, which accounts for these observations.17 Assuming that the reaction proceeds exclusively via pathway 1a/1b the first step (1a) should be rate determining to account for a benzylic oxidation in 1 to ketone 2 which is not influenced by a radical scavenger, while the oxidation of alcohol 3 (pathway 1b) to the same product is significantly accelerated by its addition. Contradictorily, a comparison between the initial rate of oxidation of 1 and 3, shows that the oxidation of the latter is in fact slower than the oxidation of the former. On the other hand, if the second step (pathway 1b) would be rate determining, one expects a build-up of alcohol in the reaction mixture. This is not the case since only small amounts are present during the reaction course (vide supra). These contradictions imply that an indirect pathway 1a/1b can be excluded and our reaction proceeds via a direct pathway 2 with the formation of 3 as side compound. In addition to the kinetic experiments using TEMPO we also tried to isolate TEMPO-adducts to find out whether stable radical species were formed during the reaction.18 No such adducts could be observed via LC-MS analysis. When using 1,1-diphenylethylene as an alternative radical scavenger the oxidation reaction was also not inhibited and 1 was fully converted into ketone 2 and 1,1-diphenylethylene was quantitatively recovered.19a Next to these soluble radical scavengers activated carbon was used as a solid scavenger. Also in this case no inhibition could be detected (Fig. S27†).19b These results suggest that no stable organic radical species are formed in solution during the course of this reaction. This is also supported by EPR analysis (vide infra).\\n\\nFig. 3 Effect of TEMPO on the rate of the oxidation reaction of 1 and 3.\\n\\nConsidering that TEMPO, 1,1-diphenylethylene and activated carbon are bimolecular probes and oxygen is also a radical trap, we synthesized a substrate which can act as an intramolecular probe for a benzylic radical. 2-(2-Allylbenzyl)pyridine (26) was selected for this purpose. While benzylic radical clocks are known to be relatively slow due to the inherent stability of the benzylic radical, the reported unimolecular rate constant (k = 3 × 102 s–1) is still a factor of 107 faster than our overall maximum reaction rate (2 × 10–5 M s–1) (vide infra).19c (2-Allylphenyl)(pyridin-2-yl)methanone (27) was formed and no ring closed products due to radical cyclization could be detected in the reaction mixture (Scheme 3). Formation of 27 further supports that a free benzylic radical is not involved in our reaction protocol.\\n\\nScheme 3 Benzylic radical clock reaction.\\n\\nIt is important to determine whether mass-transfer effects are in play since O2 is a gaseous reagent.20 The effect of the stirring on the initial reaction rate was examined at 0.2 M of catalyst (Fig. 4). It was found that up until 550 rpm there is a first order relation of the stirring rate on the initial rate of the reaction. At higher stirring rates the vi becomes independent. From this we can conclude that at a certain reaction rate (vmax) the uptake of O2 becomes rate limiting. From the stirring rate experiment we see that the value of vmax is approximately 1.2 mM min–1. Under our standard reaction conditions we work at a stirring rate of 700 rpm and thus no mass-transfer effects are in play.\\n\\nFig. 4 Effect of the stirring rate on the initial reaction rate.\\n\\nA first order dependence was found for the O2 partial pressure (Fig. 5, upper right, solid line). Since this first order relation might also derive from the observed mass transfer limitation effects we also examined the influence of the O2 partial pressure at a very low catalyst concentration (6.25 mM versus 50 mM) to make sure that no mass transfer limitation is in play. In this instance again a first order relation was found (dashed line). From this we can conclude that the observed first order relation derives directly from the involvement of O2 in or before the rate determining step.\\n\\nFig. 5 Dependence of the copper-catalyzed oxidation of 2-benzylpyridine (1) on [1] (upper left), O2 partial pressure (upper right), [Cu] (lower left) and [AcOH] (lower right) on the initial reaction rate. The dashed curve for the [CuI] (lower left) is a fit of the following equation: d[2]/dt = (c1[Cu]2 + c2[Cu])/(c3[Cu]2 + c4[Cu] + c5) to the datapoints (■). The data points for the [AcOH] and [1] respectively fit to the following equations: d[2]/dt = c1[AcOH]/(c2[AcOH] + c3) and d[2]/dt = c1[1]/(c2[1] + c3). Reaction conditions: 1 (5 mmol), CuI (10 mol%), AcOH (1 eq.), O2 (balloon), DMSO (10 mL), 100 °C.\\n\\nFor the substrate (1) as well as for the acetic acid concentration saturation kinetics are seen. A quasi linear (first order) dependence is observed when less than 1 equivalent (0.5 M) of acetic acid or 1 is used (Fig. 5, upper left and lower right). When higher concentrations are used the reaction approaches zeroth order for the acid and 1 concentrations. This saturation behavior with vmax at approximately 1.2 mM min–1 is due to the occurrence of O2 mass transfer limitation conditions as was the case for the stirring experiments (vide supra).20 The measured data points are in accordance with hyperbolic functions (see ESI† for derivations). An alternative explanation for the saturation behavior might be the formation of a pre-equilibrium between substrate, AcOH and catalyst before rate determining oxygenation.17b This scenario, however, can be excluded. After all, when the concentration of these three components was raised simultaneously, thereby keeping their respective ratios constant, the initial rate again showed the same vmax value (Fig. S16†).\\n\\nThe dependence of the reaction rate on the catalyst concentration follows a more complex pattern. At very low catalyst concentrations the rate increases very fast in a hyperbolic fashion. At a rate of 1.2 mM min–1 it also reaches a maximum and after that the reaction rate becomes invariant of the catalyst concentration. The value of this maximum is determined by the O2 mass transfer limitation and corresponds to the vmax that was observed for [AcOH] and [1]. However, when the catalyst loading is further increased, the reaction rate diminishes significantly (Fig. 5, lower left) to finally settle at a constant rate independent of the catalyst concentration. As the occurrence of mass transfer limitation would result in a hyperbolic curve approaching 1.2 mM min–1 as vmax, the significant drop in initial rate cannot be explained by the occurrence of mass transfer limitation and another factor has to be taken into account. Other examples of non-linear dependence on [catalyst] for aerobic oxidations have previously been reported by the groups of Stahl and Sheldon.17b,21 We attribute the continuous drop in rate to the existence of dinuclear Cu-species. Trapping the active catalyst in a dinuclear species can inhibit the reaction since adding more catalyst will only result in the formation of more dimer via a second order process in [catalyst]. The non-zero reaction rate at very high catalyst loadings can only be explained by considering that these dinuclear species are also catalytically active (rate constant kd), however substantially less reactive than the mononuclear species (rate constant km) (km > kd). This is interesting as usually non-reactive dinuclear complexes are considered. A rate law (eqn (1)) was derived (see ESI†) which takes into account reactive di-nuclear complexes but no mass transfer limitation.22 A very good fit could be obtained for the data points before and after mass transfer limitation (dashed line). Between a copper concentration from 25 mM to 125 mM (triangles) where O2 diffusion is at play the simulated rate is much higher than the measured data points as expected.1\\n\\nTo support the catalytic activity at very high catalyst loading an experiment was performed with a stoichiometric catalyst loading. Significant conversion and a moderate yield was seen after 24 hours (Scheme 4) which is in accordance with the kinetic measurements. No significant side reactions take place at high catalyst loading as the reaction gave a good mass balance (>90%).\\n\\nScheme 4 Control experiments with (super) stoichiometric amounts of catalyst.\\n\\nTo exclude the possibility of any catalyst degradation the reaction was monitored with in situ IR and, after the reaction was complete, another batch of substrate (1) was added. The second reaction proceeded with no significant loss in reaction rate (see Fig. S21†). Work-up of this reaction mixture provided ketone 2 in 92% yield with no starting material remaining. From this we conclude that no significant degradation of the catalyst to inactive (dimeric) species is occurring.\\n\\n\\nStructure of the catalytic species: an EPR-study\\n\\nIn order to identify the copper species present during the reaction, continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed EPR experiments were performed on the oxidation reaction of the model substrate 1 shown in Scheme 1.23 In the initial screening of catalysts it was shown that the reaction worked well for most copper sources, irrespective of the oxidation state (Cu0, CuI, CuII).11a As we are working under O2 atmosphere in the presence of acetic acid, the active catalytic species is likely to contain a CuII center and the reaction therefore involves initial oxidation when salts at lower oxidation state are used as precatalyst (eqn (2)).242\\n\\nThe oxidation of CuI in the presence of pyridine to hydroxide-bridged polynuclear complexes has been well-documented.25 The situation in our case is different: since we are able to start from a CuII source. This would require the use of H2O2 in stead of O2 to end up with the same reactive species. Possible anions for the CuII species are iodide, acetate and hydroxide. The latter is a result from the oxidation of CuI while the former two are deliberately added to the reaction. Since no ligand is added it is likely that DMSO will ligate (S- or O-ligation) to the copper center to stabilize it in solution.26 Alternatively the substrate (1) or reaction product (2) can also act as a ligand. The intermediate reacting with O2 likely contains a CuII–C(sp3) bond with the methylene carbon (Fig. 10, B and B′). As stated above this bond can be formed through initial tautomerization of substrate followed by reaction with copper species. However, since the equilibrium of this tautomerization is highly shifted towards the imine tautomer we expect the concentration of this intermediate to be very low during the course of the reaction.\\n\\nFirstly, control CW-EPR measurements at 100 K were performed on a solution of 0.05 M CuI in DMSO heated to 100 °C during 10 minutes under O2 atmosphere (Fig. S1(a)†). The CuII complex observed (species I) (Table 2, entry 1) has g and copper hyperfine values that are similar to those reported earlier for CuBr2·2H2O in DMSO and is in accordance with the complexation of CuII with DMSO ligands.27 The same experiment was performed, but now in the presence of 0.5 M AcOH (Fig. S1(b)†); copper(ii) acetate is known to exist mainly in a dinuclear form Cu2(OAc)4 in acetic acid and other solvents, with only a small amount of mononuclear Cu(OAc)2 complex present.28 Both types of CuII species (monomeric and multimeric) can be distinguished by EPR. Indeed, two CuII mononuclear complexes (species I′ and II) are detected (Table 2, entry 2, Fig. S1(b)†), together with high-field signals from CuII dimers (Fig. S2†). Species I′ has parameters similar to those of the complex observed without acetic acid and can be assigned to the same complex. The small shifts in the parameters are induced by the change in the dielectric constant of the mixture. Species II features EPR parameters similar to those observed earlier for Cu(OAc)2·2H2O in different solvents.29 With regard to the dinuclear species, the strong antiferromagnetic coupling within the pair of copper ions in Cu2(OAc)4 generally results in a triplet state that lies approximately 250–300 cm–1 (=|J|) above the singlet state, with typical zero-field splitting (D) for the triplet of the order of 0.34 cm–1 and characteristic EPR spectra.30 Fig. S2† shows the temperature dependence of one of the high-field signals of this contribution, from which the exchange coupling J can be determined (J = –274 cm–1), in agreement with what was earlier reported for Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2, namely J = –269 cm–1 in frozen acid solution.31 In the EPR spectra of the mixture without addition of acetic acid (Table 2, entry 1), no such dinuclear copper complex could be found, in accordance with the absence of bridging ligands.\\n\\nTable 2\\nEntry\\t[CuI] (M)\\tHeating time\\tg\\tg\\tg\\t|\\t|\\t|\\n1\\tCuI/DMSO\\t0.05\\t10′\\tI\\t2.082\\t2.087\\t2.405\\t45\\t55\\t385\\n2\\tCuI/DMSO/AcOH\\t0.05\\t10′\\tI′\\t2.081\\t2.083\\t2.403\\t26\\t25\\t375\\nII\\t2.080\\t2.374\\t30\\t26\\t430\\n3\\tCuI/DMSO/AcOH/(\\t0.05\\t5′\\tIII\\t2.070\\t2.333\\t25\\t440\\nIV\\t2.062\\t2.063\\t2.286\\t35\\t510\\n4\\tCuI/DMSO/AcOH/(\\t0.05\\t10′\\tIII\\t2.070\\t2.333\\t25\\t440\\nIV\\t2.062\\t2.063\\t2.286\\t35\\t510\\n5\\tCuI/DMSO/AcOH/(\\t0.05\\t1 h\\tIV\\t2.063\\t2.285\\t30\\t510\\n6\\tCuI/DMSO/AcOH/(\\t0.05\\t4 h\\tIV′\\t2.063\\t2.290\\t30\\t505\\nV\\t2.067\\t2.262\\t35\\t560\\n7\\tCuI/DMSO/AcOH/(\\t0.25\\t10′\\tIV\\t2.066\\t2.286\\t35\\t510\\nIII\\t2.072\\t2.330\\t25\\t450\\n8\\tCuI/DMSO/AcOH/(\\t0.25\\t4 h\\tIV\\t2.062\\t2.063\\t2.285\\t35\\t510\\nIII\\t2.075\\t2.072\\t2.334\\t25\\t455\\n\\nChart 1 Mono- and dinuclear copper species present in the reaction.\\n\\nNext, EPR measurements were done on reaction mixtures. Fig. 6A shows the EPR spectra observed after heating a reaction mixture for 5 min, 10 min, 1 h and 4 h. The field area specific for mononuclear CuII complexes is shown for the spectra recorded at 100 K. None of the EPR spectra showed signals typical of organic radicals. Instead, a clear evolution of mononuclear CuII complexes is observed in function of the reaction time, with different species contributing to the spectra, as is best visible in the low-field range (Fig. 6B). At short reaction times (5 and 10 min), the EPR spectra revealed two species, labeled III and IV, with the contribution of III decreasing over time. After 1 h, only component IV is left and as the reaction progresses, a contribution of a new species V starts to emerge. The EPR parameters of species IV are slightly changing with time (species IV′), which may be related to changes in the direct neighborhood of the complex. The EPR spectrum of species III can be obtained by a weighted subtraction of the spectra recorded after 5 and 10 minutes (bottom spectrum in Fig. 6A). In the high-field region, clearly resolved hyperfine couplings are visible that can be satisfactorily simulated considering the interaction of the unpaired electron with the copper nucleus and with two 14N surrounding nuclei. The hyperfine coupling of the latter interaction (40 MHz) is similar to that obtained for the hyperfine value of the pyridine nitrogen nuclei in Cu(py)4 complexes.32 Given that species III is observed at an early stage of the reaction it can be ascribed to an initial complexation of the copper ion with two 2-benzylpyridine (1) molecules, [Cu(DMSO)n(1)2]Y2 (Fig. 6), where n = 2, 3 or 4 and Y = –OH, –I or –OAc. Moreover, when the same reaction is carried out in toluene instead of DMSO, the CW-EPR signal after 5 minutes reaction (Fig. S12†) shows only species with g and A parameters similar to species IV (see Table S3†), without contribution from DMSO-related species III. The EPR parameters of species IV are very close to those reported for a powder of Cu(O2CCPh3)2·2py and for a frozen solution of CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O in pyridine.33,34 Addition of pyridine to dinuclear copper carboxylates has been shown to yield dinuclear complexes in equilibrium with mononuclear species of the form Cu(O2CR)2py2.31 The structure of IV can therefore be assigned to Cu(OAc)2(1)2 (Fig. 6). This is further supported by the decrease of gz and increase of |Az| compared to complex I and II, which is expected if more N-bases are ligated to the CuII than in the former case. The pulsed EPR analysis also confirmed the involvement of 2-benzylpyridine (1) ligation in the mononuclear species IV (see ESI†). The influence of acetic acid on the N-coordination of 1 is negligible (Fig. S13 and S14†). Furthermore, it has been reported that substitution of one N by one C in copper(ii) porphyrins significantly lowers the gz value and increases |Ax,y| to values significantly different from those observed for species III and IV.35 Hence, ligand to catalyst coordination through a Cu–C bond can be discarded in species III and IV.\\n\\nFig. 6 Experimental (cyan) and simulated (black) CW-EPR spectra of the reaction mixture with 0.05 M CuI and 0.5 M 2-benzylpyridine (1), 0.5 M acetic acid and DMSO heated to 100 °C under O2 for 5 min, 10 min, 1 h and 4 h.

Fig. 7 shows a temperature analysis of one of the high-field EPR signals from copper dimers displayed in the inset. The EPR intensity variation can be fit using the Bleaney–Bower equation (eqn (3)), yielding a value for the exchange coupling J of –306 cm–1.363\\n\\nFig. 7 Temperature evolution of the EPR intensity of one of the high-field EPR signals typical for copper dimers (■) formed in the reaction mixture: 2-benzylpyridine (1) 0.5 M, 0.05 M CuI, 0.5 M acetic acid and DMSO heated to 100 °C under O2 for 1 h. The red curve shows the fit using eqn (3). The inset shows the high-field EPR signal used for the evaluation. The spectra were recorded using a microwave frequency of 9.73 GHz and a microwave power of 0.047 mW.\\n\\nThis is larger in absolute value than the one found for the copper acetate dimer, agreeing with the earlier observation that addition of pyridine to copper carboxylates yields dinuclear Cu2(O2CR)4py2 complex with increased |J| value.31 Furthermore, slight changes in the position of EPR peaks are observed, indicative of a change in the D values of the triplet state. The changes in J and D prove the presence of dinuclear copper species with ligation of 2-benzylpyridine (1), in accordance with Cu2(OAc)4(1)2 (species VI).\\n\\nInterestingly, mononuclear complexes III and IV are also found in the EPR spectra of the reaction mixture using a higher copper concentration of 0.25 M (Fig. S5†). However, here the contribution of species III dominates the EPR spectrum even after 4 h of reaction (Table 2, entries 7 and 8, spectrum not shown), while it disappears within the first hour in the reaction mixture with a 0.05 M copper concentration (Fig. 6B, Table 2, entries 3–6). This can be rationalized when considering that the Cu(OAc)2(1)2 complex (IV) is readily formed for high [1]/[CuII] and [AcOH]/[CuII] ratios, as is the case for our standard reaction conditions. However, when the copper concentration is increased, the relative amount of acetate per copper is lower and mononuclear copper complexes involving 1 and/or DMSO with I– or HO– as anions, instead of 1 and acetate may be formed at higher relative quantities.\\n\\nComplex V is only resolved in the EPR spectra of the reaction mixture with low copper content after a longer (4 h) reaction time (Table 2, entry 6, Fig. 6B). Since the [2]/[CuII] ratio can already be significant at this stage of the reaction, the ligation of 2 to the copper complex becomes competitive. In the reaction with high copper content, the [2] may be too small for the complex to be formed. Unfortunately, the copper amount was too high at this stage of the reaction for both mixtures to allow for pulsed EPR analyses to verify this possibility (too fast electronic relaxations). However, CW-EPR spectra recorded of a reference mixture of CuI, AcOH and ketone 2 revealed the presence of a type-V species (see ESI, Fig. S6–S7†) supporting our hypothesis. The trend in the EPR parameters suggests a higher number of nitrogen ligands in the case of species V than for species III and IV, suggesting an extra ligation of 2 to a copper ion that is already ligated to two other nitrogen ligands 1.37 The assignment of species I–VI is summarized in Chart 1\\n\\nIn order to check the influence of the measurement temperature on the occurrence of the different copper species, CW-EPR experiments were performed at different temperatures. Fig. 8 and 9 show the room-temperature CW-EPR spectra of the copper-catalyzed oxidation of 2-benzylpyridine (1) with starting concentrations of 0.05 M and 0.25 M CuI, respectively, recorded on aliquots of the reaction mixture taken at different times in the reaction. Again, none of the spectra show contributions of organic radicals, confirming the low-temperature EPR results and the kinetic experiments using radical scavengers. In line with the low-temperature EPR (Fig. 6 and S5†), a significant variation of the EPR spectrum can be seen during the course of the reaction involving a lower copper loading due to contributions of species III and IV (Fig. 8), whereas a negligible variation is seen when a higher amount of copper is used (Fig. 9) (see also detailed comparison in ESI, Fig. S8 and S9†). Comparison of the latter spectra with the EPR spectrum of the solution without substrate 1 (bottom Fig. 9) suggests a strong contribution of CuII complexes that are related to species I and II. This is surprising, since no contributions of these species were observed in the spectra at 100 K (Fig. S5†). This indicates that the equilibrium of reaction (4) shifts to the right as temperature decreases.4\\n\\nFig. 8 Room-temperature X-band CW-EPR spectra of the copper-catalyzed oxidation of 1 with 0.05 M CuI recorded in function of time. The spectra are recorded with a microwave power of 0.047 mW and a microwave frequency of 9.73 GHz.\\n\\nFig. 9 Room-temperature X-band CW-EPR spectra of the copper-catalyzed oxidation of 1 with 0.25 M CuI in function of time. At the bottom, the corresponding spectrum of the reaction mixture without the substrate 1 is shown. The spectra are recorded with a microwave power of 0.047 mW and a microwave frequency of 9.73 GHz.\\n\\nA high [1]/[CuII] ratio evidently also pushes the equilibrium to the right, explaining why the contribution of species III and IV can still be seen and I and II are less dominant in the room-temperature spectra of the reaction mixture at lower CuI concentration (Fig. 8).\\n\\nAlthough clear evidence of the presence of dinuclear species in the reaction mixture with 0.05 M CuI (Table 2, entries 3–6) and the CuI/DMSO/AcOH system (Table 2, entry 2) is found at low temperatures (Fig. S2† and 7), no signals due to dimers are observed in the EPR spectra at room temperature (Fig. S10†). This is not due to the absence of the dimers, but is simply due to spectral broadening effects as reported earlier by others for dinuclear copper acetate species.38 Large CuII concentrations are required to be able to observe the typical EPR features stemming from dinuclear copper species at room temperature (Fig. S11,† signals indicated with arrows). The amount of dinuclear species is clearly increasing during the reaction time. Furthermore, the signal change at a later stage of the experiment (see for instance the appearance of a peak around 480 mT) is indicative of variation in the types of dinuclear complexes that are formed under these circumstances. This points to a variation in the axial ligands L of Cu2(OAc)4L2; 1, 2 or solvent molecules. Further proof for these acetate bridged dinuclear CuII species was obtained using infrared spectroscopy. When working at increasing concentrations of added CuI, new peaks started to arise in the infrared spectrum of the reaction mixture. By deconvolution of the overall IR spectrum a new IR spectrum could be obtained. The resulting spectrum matches with that of Cu(OAc)2·2H2O in DMSO which is known to exist as a dinuclear species and a reported dinuclear acetate bridged CuII complex (see Fig. S23 and S24†).39 Furthermore, increasing amounts of CuI cause a decrease in the concentration of free AcOH in the reaction mixture. This can be monitored by following the decrease in area of the C\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 1111111111111111111111111111111111\\n 1111111111111111111111111111111111\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 1111111111111111111111111111111111\\n 1111111111111111111111111111111111\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n 0000000000000000000000000000000000\\n\\tO bond vibration of AcOH (around 1718 cm–1).

Aerobic oxidation of the added CuI brings the catalyst to the active +II oxidation state (complexes I–IV). An initial acid-catalyzed imine–enamine tautomerization, characterized by the equilibrium constant Keq transforms the substrate 1 into the enamine tautomer A. Nucleophilic attack of A on an electrophilic CuII center (monomer IV or dimer VI) produces a C–CuII bond (B or B′). Acetic acid acts as a catalyst for the tautomerization. Although adding an acid does not change the equilibrium between 1 and A, it will lower the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate by which enamine A is replenished. All these steps are reversible and in rapid equilibrium characterized by their respective equilibrium constants. Their relative concentrations depend on the initial reaction conditions (the ratios between all the reaction components: substrate, catalyst, acid and solvent). In the next step the CuII center that is bound to the substrate molecule will be oxidized by O2 to a highly reactive CuIII-superoxide species (C or C′).40,41 The oxidation of B/B′ is thought to be the rate determining step and it is herein that lies the difference in reaction rate for mononuclear (km) versus dinuclear (kd) catalyst species (km > kd). The superoxide species will quickly rearrange via a radical pathway with an electron transfer to the catalyst producing the CuII organoperoxide D or D′. Heterolytic dissociation of these organoperoxides by deprotonation of the remaining benzylic proton produces the reaction product 2 and recovers the catalyst with a hydroxide rather than an acetate bound (E or E′).42E and E′ can be converted back to IV and VI by anion exchange with acetate, hereby producing one equivalent of water.43\\n\\nFig. 10 Mechanistic proposal for the aerobic Cu-catalyzed oxidation of 1 into 2.\\n\\nThe amount of O2 required to make one molecule of ketone was determined by performing gas uptake experiments. It was found that when using CuI (10 mol%) as the catalyst the O2\\u2009:\\u2009substrate stoichiometry is ∼1 (see ESI†). These results confirm that in accordance with our mechanistic proposal for each molecule of product one molecule of water is formed and that no extra oxygen is required to oxidize the catalyst during the catalytic cycle.\\n\\nFor our proposed catalytic cycle a kinetic isotope effect is expected even though C–H/D bond cleavage is not included in the rate-determining step. As the C–H bond cleavage (via imine–enamine tautomerization) is reversible and its k–1 is much faster than the k2 of the RDS (oxygenation), the observed KIE is the equilibrium isotope effect.44 When comparing the initial rates of the reaction on 1 using AcOH with that of 1-d2 using AcOD-d4 a KIE value of 4.28 was found (Fig. S19†). As an additional experiment we tested if deuterium could be build-in via tautomerization under our reaction conditions. When mixing 2-benzylpyridine with d4-AcOD in deuterated DMSO in the absence of catalyst and O2 the singlet of the benzylic protons started to disappear in 1H-NMR and a broad triplet resulting from 1-d1 started to appear further supporting the imine–enamine tautomerization (see ESI Fig. S20†). In contrast, diphenylmethane (8) could not be deuterated in the same manner as expected.\\n\\nThe EPR experiments (Table 2) indicate that the catalyst resting state is species IV with even at low [catalyst] a significant contribution of dinuclear species VI. When the [catalyst] is increased the equilibrium is significantly shifted towards the dinuclear species VI. Because the equilibrium between the imine (1) and enamine (A) tautomers is highly shifted towards the imine (1) the concentration of species B and B′ is expected to be very low which explains why these species were never directly observed by EPR measurements. The reason why the dinuclear species oxidize slower than the mononuclear is unclear. The simplest explanation is the increased steric bulk of the catalyst (4 bridging acetates). However it is also possible that the second CuII in C′ reacts with the formed CuIII-superoxide species producing a less reactive dioxygen bridged species.\\n\\nFormation of side product 3 can occur via protonation of intermediate D or D′ producing a hydroperoxide that can undergo a Fenton like CuI-catalyzed homolytical cleavage of the O–O bond yielding alcohol 3 and a hydroxyl radical. This radical is known to be very reactive and thus very short-lived.45 Alcohol 3 is formed in such small quantities so that an in-depth study of the mechanism of its formation was not possible. Alcohol 3 can be transformed into 2 by copper-catalyzed β-hydride elimination (Scheme 2).16\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThis research has provided deeper insight into the mechanism of CuII-catalyzed aerobic oxygenations. Although the mechanism of Cu-catalyzed aerobic alcohol oxidation has been thoroughly studied, kinetic studies on the corresponding methylene oxidation are unprecedented. Only reactions on stoichiometric Cu-complexes with oxygen have been reported. In this study we have shown that the substrates are activated via an initial acid catalyzed imine–enamine tautomerization. DFT calculations can be used as useful method to predict the equilibrium constant (Keq) and can act as a tool to qualitatively predict whether or not a substrate can be oxidized. Alcohol 3 was excluded as an intermediate in this reaction and is a side product presumably generated by the homolytical breaking of the O–O bond in the hydroperoxide formed from complex D/D′via protonation. Kinetic studies revealed O2 mass transfer limitation effects limiting the turnover of the reaction at high concentrations of substrate and acetic acid. A complex kinetic behavior was observed when increasing the catalyst loading. At intermediate loadings mass transfer is again occurring resulting in a maximum rate. The continued decrease of the reaction rate at higher concentrations of catalyst however can't be explained by the occurrence of mass transfer alone. When using transition metal catalysis in combination with (acetate) bridging ligands dinuclear species need to be considered. Although these are usually considered to be related to catalyst deactivation this study shows this is not necessarily the case as they explain the further reduction in rate observed at a higher concentration than at which the mass transfer determined vmax occurs. The formation of a dinuclear catalytically active species which is less reactive than the mononuclear catalyst explains the non-zero reaction rate at increased concentration of added catalyst. Such behavior is to the best of our knowledge unprecedented in literature. In addition to these kinetic experiments we performed an in-depth EPR-study to characterize the catalytic species present in the reaction. These measurements confirmed the presence of both different mono- and dinuclear CuII-species. The results presented in this paper can directly be used in the mechanistic study of other active methylene oxygenations where the methylene moiety is activated by a tautomerization step.\\n\\n\\nSupplementary MaterialSupplementary information\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.\", 'text_matches': ['field area'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'research-article'}, 'article_title': 'Mechanism of the CuII-catalyzed benzylic oxygenation of (aryl)(heteroaryl)methanes with oxygen†\\n†Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

However, most previous studies of microrobots used manual motion control to navigate past tight spaces and obstacles while very few studies demonstrated the use of autonomous motion. In this paper, we demonstrated a dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm for bacteria-powered microrobots (BPMs) using electric field in fluidic environments. A BPM consists of an artificial body, which is made of SU-8, and a high dense layer of harnessed bacteria. BPMs can be controlled using externally applied electric fields due to the electrokinetic property of bacteria. For developing dynamic obstacle avoidance for BPMs, a kinematic model of BPMs was utilized to prevent collision and a finite element model was used to characteristic the deformation of an electric field near the obstacle walls. In order to avoid fast moving obstacles, we modified our previously static obstacle avoidance approach using a modified vector field histogram (VFH) method. To validate the advanced algorithm in experiments, magnetically controlled moving obstacles were used to intercept the BPMs as the BPMs move from the initial position to final position. The algorithm was able to successfully guide the BPMs to reach their respective goal positions while avoiding the dynamic obstacles.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id=\"award001\"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"funder-id\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1306794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated=\"true\" contrib-id-type=\"orcid\">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0819-1644</contrib-id><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Min Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id=\"award002\"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"funder-id\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1712096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated=\"true\" contrib-id-type=\"orcid\">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0819-1644</contrib-id><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Min Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id=\"award003\"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=\"funder-id\">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000183</institution-id><institution>Army Research Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W911NF-11-1-0490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated=\"true\" contrib-id-type=\"orcid\">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0819-1644</contrib-id><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Min Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id=\"award004\"><funding-source><institution>Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KR)</institution></funding-source><award-id>10052980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated=\"true\" contrib-id-type=\"orcid\">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0819-1644</contrib-id><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Min Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) (DMR#1306794 and CMMI#1712096), Army Research Office (W911NF-11-1-0490), and Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE#10052980).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count=\"14\"/><table-count count=\"0\"/><page-count count=\"23\"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id=\"data-availability\"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type=\"intro\" id=\"sec001\"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well established that microscopic scale robotics has a high potential to be utilized in biological, medical, and industrial applications; despite facing many challenges. For biomedical engineering, core tasks such as localized/targeted drug delivery, micro invasive surgery, cell manipulation, biosensing, cell sorting, and cell fusion can be performed [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref001\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref006\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>]. In the field of industrial engineering, microrobots have shown their capabilities to complete microscale tasks such as micro-assembly, transport, precision micro-machining, and micro-manipulation [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref007\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref009\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>]. In order to develop swimming microrobots for these applications, there have been various challenges. The major challenge is to propel microrobots at a low Reynolds number fluidic environment where the conventional macro scale swimming methods do not work due to the negligence of inertia force caused by relatively large viscous forces. Therefore, the generation of a propulsive force to power microrobots has become a primary problem to be addressed. The widely discussed solution for low Reynolds number propulsion is to generate nonreciprocal motion which can be achieved using corkscrew motion or deformable bodies [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref010\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>] that are inspired by the movement of microorganisms and structures formed in nature [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref002\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref011\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref014\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. One of the previously explored designs is the artificial helical shaped microrobot that is coated with a metal and manipulated by magnetic fields [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref015\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref016\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>]. In addition, self-propelled micromotors have been studied using spherical Janus particles within the last decade [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref017\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>].</p><p>Another challenge is the autonomous control of microrobots and the interest of this challenge becomes significantly increasing. A navigation system will play an important role in microrobotics to complete the aforementioned tasks due to reducing any damage to the microrobot and minimizing adverse effects. In addition, the autonomous control method can supply highly efficient navigation when compared to manual motion control. Hence, the development of advanced motion control techniques is necessary for microrobots to achieve their tasks. For this purpose, motion modeling of a microrobot has been built for control and validated by manual control inputs in experiments [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref007\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref018\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>]. Furthermore, both biological and non-biological microrobots have been navigated using autonomous path planning [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref019\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref021\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>]. The path planning method ensures that the microrobot arrives at the goal position. However, in a real environment, there will be not only static but also dynamic obstacles; hence, dynamic obstacles should be considered for autonomous motion control. Herein, we suggest a dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm for BPMs.</p><p>In this paper, an autonomous motion control algorithm was developed for avoiding dynamic obstacle in real-time. We designed the experimental setup to test the algorithm using magnetically controlled moving obstacles. Then, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach experimentally by using the moving obstacles to intercept the paths of BPMs. We manufactured microrobots which use biomolecular motors from bacteria. Using the galvanotaxis of the bacteria, these microrobots can be driven by applied electric field. The autonomous navigation algorithm for static obstacle avoidance was developed [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref022\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>] after the controllability and mobility of BPMs were demonstrated in previous works [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref002\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>, <xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref023\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. For this work, a dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm is capable of computing the optimal control inputs to avoid dynamic obstacles in real-time and allows the guidance of a BPM to reach the target position without using path planning. This capability will allow BPMs to adapt to changeable environments and greatly increase their versatility for microscale applications.</p><p>To develop a dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm, several factors need to be considered due to the characteristics of the BPMs&#x02019; biological actuators and the design of the control system. The first factor is an inherent motion caused by a densely packed mono layer of bacteria, called bacterial carpet. This motion induces uncontrollable movements which lead to high probability of collision. However, the studied kinematic model of BPMs can be used to predict this motion and help to plan a safe motion. Another factor is a deformation of the electric field around dynamic obstacles. The presence of dynamic obstacles leads to non-uniform electric fields which can cause BPMs to move in undesired directions. In our proposed method, all these constraints are taken into account and the potential risk caused by dynamic obstacles is prevented in real-time. Our proposed algorithm was based on the simulation results in [<xref rid=\"pone.0185744.ref024\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>] and we focused on proving the reliability of the algorithm using magnetically controlled moving obstacles. Furthermore, the performances of the experimental results are quantified by the danger index representing the potential risk. The defined danger index was calculated using the control input and the relative position between a BPM and surrounding obstacles.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\" id=\"sec002\"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id=\"sec003\"><title>Bacteria-powered microrobots</title><sec id=\"sec004\"><title>Configuration of bacteria-powered microrobots</title><p>A BPM is an integrated robotic system using the bacteria called <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> and an inorganic material called SU-8.

In the case of moving obstacles, however, the unpredicted motion of dynamic obstacles can increase the probability of collision.

The primary concern is related to a bacterial carpet that exhibits self-actuation of a BPM which is naturally induced by flagellar motors. If the control input is not determined by considering the self-actuation of a BPM, there will be a high probability of collision with obstacles. Moreover, the velocity of dynamic obstacles can move relatively fast comparing BPMs and the sudden movement of dynamic obstacles will cause high risk situation. The other consideration is the deformation of an electric field around the obstacle area creating non-uniformities in the potential field. This deformation can be understood by the analog of a river flow around rock where the water flow around the rock is nonlinear and non-uniform. Similarly, the electric field will be distorted around a moving obstacle. This field deformation can lead to undesired motion of the BMP which increases the probability of collision with the moving obstacles. The phenomenon of non-uniform potential field was simulated using a finite element program called COMSOL Multiphysics. In the simulation, the dynamic obstacle was composed of nickel which allow for magnetic actuation and non-permeability as boundary conditions.</p><p>The simulation results indicate the distorted range around the moving obstacle over time, as shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0185744.g003\">Fig 3</xref>.

We defined four different objective functions in a main function (DWA) to select an optimal control input by considering the parameters listed above, as the BPM approaches a goal position. However, in dynamic environments where moving obstacles are presented, the objective function would not be enough to consider the motion of the dynamic obstacles because the objective function only considers the surrounding environment at a given specific moment. Instead of adding other functions to the objective function, the role of the redefined VFH is to filter out the control inputs with high risk in advance by considering the distance between the BPM and the dynamic obstacles.</p><p>The search for control inputs is carried out directly in the space of voltages with&#x02013;&#x003c0; to +&#x003c0; range of the direction for electric field. In the suggested algorithm, the search space of control inputs depends on the maximum input voltage in the system setup.</p><p>There are three steps in the suggested algorithm to determine the commands controlling the BPM. In the first step of the algorithm, the modified VFH function is implemented to restrict the candidate control inputs from the search space when obstacles are located within the safe range as shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0185744.g005\">Fig 5A</xref>. Even though the distance between the BPM and the obstacle was far initially, if the dynamic obstacle moves close to the BPM at high speed, the BPM might not be able to avoid collision in short time intervals. Therefore, we used the concept of VFH to exclude the motion inputs that drive a BPM toward the valley, occupied by the dynamic obstacles, in vector histogram. The inputs heading for obstacles will have 0 value from the defined VFH function (&#x003bd;(<italic>U</italic>, <italic>&#x003b8;</italic>)) as follow:\\n<disp-formula

The BPM started at the right bottom corner and the goal was at the left top corner. During 0&#x02013;10s, the BPM and the D1 were position far apart. After 10s, the potential risk increased due to closing distance between D1 and the BPM. As the distance becomes smaller at 15s, the strong self-actuated motion began to lead to a higher potential risk compared with the previous experiments, as shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"pone.0185744.g011\">Fig 11A and 11E</xref>. However, the BPM avoided collision due to the control inputs computed using low danger index. While D1 stayed in front of the BPM, the BPM was able to continuously dodge the moving obstacle in real-time. Notably, the BPM was waiting at the right side of the goal area while D1 was occupying the goal location. Once D1 left from the goal location, the BPM went to the goal position from the place where it waited; much like a midfielder passing the defenders to score a goal.

To successfully implement the algorithm in experiments, we took into account the uncontrollable motion of BPMs and the distorted electric field near the obstacles. Our suggested objective function includes four functions for extracting optimal control inputs. The sub functions of the objective function are <italic>heading</italic>, <italic>movement</italic>, <italic>clearance</italic>, and <italic>control</italic>. The algorithm determines the safe motion control input that maximizes four performance categories&#x02014;goal arrival, no collision, speed, and controllability. The exerted control inputs are selected from the admissible control input window during a sampling time. Instead of adding other functions to the objective function, the redefined VFH concept is utilized to eliminate control inputs which may lead to collision.</p><p>Five experiments have been executed in different setup with various circumstances. Moreover, we used strong self-actuated BPMs in experiments in order to evaluate the robustness of the control system. Our proposed approach allows the target BPMs to arrive at the goal positions without collision with single or multiple dynamic obstacles. To evaluate the performance of each result motion, the danger index was applied to compare the potential risk caused by the chosen control input. The danger index is computed using two factors that are how much the control input can steer the BPM from the obstacle and what is the distance between the BPM and obstacles. Through danger-evaluation method, we can quantify the performance of the results in terms of safety. All experiments have low average danger index values.</p><p>We believe the successful implementation of the dynamics obstacle avoidance algorithm demonstrated the viability for using autonomous systems to control microrobots for accurate navigation. For future work, the dynamic obstacle algorithm will be implemented in an environment with unpredictable moving obstacles.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"supplementary-material\" id=\"sec021\"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0185744.s001\"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Parameters for experiments.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0185744.s001.pdf\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0185744.s002\"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Video of dynamic obstacle avoidance Exp1.</title><p>(MP4)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0185744.s002.mp4\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0185744.s003\"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Video of dynamic obstacle avoidance Exp2.</title><p>(MP4)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0185744.s003.mp4\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0185744.s004\"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Video of dynamic obstacle avoidance Exp3.</title><p>(MP4)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0185744.s004.mp4\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0185744.s005\"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Video of multi dynamic obstacle avoidance Exp4.</title><p>(MP4)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0185744.s005.mp4\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type=\"local-data\" id=\"pone.0185744.s006\"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Supporting information for fabrication of BPM.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href=\"pone.0185744.s006.pdf\"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) (DMR#1306794 and CMMI#1712096), Army Research Office (W911NF-11-1-0490), and Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE#10052980).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id=\"pone.0185744.ref001\"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"journal\"><name><surname>Abbott</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nagy</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Beyeler</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>Robotics in the small, part I: microbotics</article-title>. <source>IEEE Rob Autom Mag</source>. <year>2007</year>;<volume>14</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>92</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>103</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id=\"pone.0185744.ref002\"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"other\">Sakar MS, Steager EB, Julius AA, Kim M, Kumar V, Pappas GJ, editors.

For biomedical engineering, core tasks such as localized/targeted drug delivery, micro invasive surgery, cell manipulation, biosensing, cell sorting, and cell fusion can be performed [1–6]. In the field of industrial engineering, microrobots have shown their capabilities to complete microscale tasks such as micro-assembly, transport, precision micro-machining, and micro-manipulation [7–9]. In order to develop swimming microrobots for these applications, there have been various challenges. The major challenge is to propel microrobots at a low Reynolds number fluidic environment where the conventional macro scale swimming methods do not work due to the negligence of inertia force caused by relatively large viscous forces. Therefore, the generation of a propulsive force to power microrobots has become a primary problem to be addressed. The widely discussed solution for low Reynolds number propulsion is to generate nonreciprocal motion which can be achieved using corkscrew motion or deformable bodies [10] that are inspired by the movement of microorganisms and structures formed in nature [2, 11–14]. One of the previously explored designs is the artificial helical shaped microrobot that is coated with a metal and manipulated by magnetic fields [15, 16]. In addition, self-propelled micromotors have been studied using spherical Janus particles within the last decade [17].\\n\\nAnother challenge is the autonomous control of microrobots and the interest of this challenge becomes significantly increasing. A navigation system will play an important role in microrobotics to complete the aforementioned tasks due to reducing any damage to the microrobot and minimizing adverse effects. In addition, the autonomous control method can supply highly efficient navigation when compared to manual motion control. Hence, the development of advanced motion control techniques is necessary for microrobots to achieve their tasks. For this purpose, motion modeling of a microrobot has been built for control and validated by manual control inputs in experiments [7, 18]. Furthermore, both biological and non-biological microrobots have been navigated using autonomous path planning [19–21]. The path planning method ensures that the microrobot arrives at the goal position. However, in a real environment, there will be not only static but also dynamic obstacles; hence, dynamic obstacles should be considered for autonomous motion control. Herein, we suggest a dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm for BPMs.\\n\\nIn this paper, an autonomous motion control algorithm was developed for avoiding dynamic obstacle in real-time. We designed the experimental setup to test the algorithm using magnetically controlled moving obstacles. Then, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach experimentally by using the moving obstacles to intercept the paths of BPMs. We manufactured microrobots which use biomolecular motors from bacteria. Using the galvanotaxis of the bacteria, these microrobots can be driven by applied electric field. The autonomous navigation algorithm for static obstacle avoidance was developed [22] after the controllability and mobility of BPMs were demonstrated in previous works [2, 23]. For this work, a dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm is capable of computing the optimal control inputs to avoid dynamic obstacles in real-time and allows the guidance of a BPM to reach the target position without using path planning. This capability will allow BPMs to adapt to changeable environments and greatly increase their versatility for microscale applications.\\n\\nTo develop a dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm, several factors need to be considered due to the characteristics of the BPMs’ biological actuators and the design of the control system. The first factor is an inherent motion caused by a densely packed mono layer of bacteria, called bacterial carpet. This motion induces uncontrollable movements which lead to high probability of collision. However, the studied kinematic model of BPMs can be used to predict this motion and help to plan a safe motion. Another factor is a deformation of the electric field around dynamic obstacles. The presence of dynamic obstacles leads to non-uniform electric fields which can cause BPMs to move in undesired directions. In our proposed method, all these constraints are taken into account and the potential risk caused by dynamic obstacles is prevented in real-time. Our proposed algorithm was based on the simulation results in [24] and we focused on proving the reliability of the algorithm using magnetically controlled moving obstacles. Furthermore, the performances of the experimental results are quantified by the danger index representing the potential risk. The defined danger index was calculated using the control input and the relative position between a BPM and surrounding obstacles.\\n\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n\\n\\nBacteria-powered microrobots\\n\\n\\nConfiguration of bacteria-powered microrobots\\n\\nA BPM is an integrated robotic system using the bacteria called Serratia marcescens and an inorganic material called SU-8. Using a slimy material secreted from the bacterial bodies, these bacteria can be attached onto the surfaces of SU-8 microstructures [25, 26]. The SU-8 Structures, which serve as the bodies of the BPMs, are fabricated using photolithography. Through blotting directly on a bacterial colony on an agar plate, hundreds or thousands of bacteria can be harnessed onto the surface of the microfabricated SU-8 structures [27]. The blotted structures are released in water based fluids through the use of a water-soluble sacrificial layer [28]. These released microstructures, BPMs, are free to move through the fluid, as shown in Fig 1A.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g001Fig 1 Introduction of BPMs.(a)Self-actuation induced by bacterial carpet during 19.2s, (b)A Schematic of the BPM (ellipse: bacterium, Ni: i-th bacterium).The scale bar represents 20 μm.\\n\\n\\nPropulsion of BPMs\\n\\nTo generate propulsive force at low Reynolds number, the BPMs utilize hydrodynamics of flagella from the bacterial carpet attached to the bottom of the SU-8 microstructure. The hydrodynamics is the result of individual bacteria flagellar waving [29]. The flagella on the carpet undergo corkscrew motions which are nonreciprocal and the collective motion of the flagella helps the BPM to overcome friction on the bottom surface and the viscosity present in a low Reynolds fluid. Moreover, the harnessed bacterial propulsion generates self-actuated motion without external stimulus. Fig 1A represents the self-actuation of a BPM during 19.2s with a clockwise rotation. The self-actuation will be useful to adjust the orientation of the BPM as examined in [23]. The negatively charged bacteria bodies will generate electrophoretic motion in the presence of an electric field. By controlling the direction and the magnitude of the electric field, we were able to generate translation motion of BPMs.\\n\\n\\nStochastic model for BPMs\\n\\nThere are two velocity components for translational movement which depends on x-axis and y-axis in the local coordinate frame with respect to the center of mass [14]. For the rotational motion of the BPM, the angular velocity, α˙, is related to the position of the i-th bacterium and its orientation angle θi as shown in Fig 1B. As a result, the equations of translational and rotational velocity of self-actuation can be expressed by\\n[VxLVyLα˙]≔p¯[1kT∑i=1Nbcos\\u2061θi1kT∑i=1Nbsin\\u2061θi1kR∑i=1Nb(bi,xsin\\u2061θi−bi,ycos\\u2061θi)]=p¯[β1β2β3](1)\\nwhere Nb and θi are the number of bacteria and the orientation of bacteria on the surface of the microstructure, and kT and kR are the translational viscous drag coefficient and rotational viscous drag coefficients, respectively. The inherent movement of BPMs is dependent upon parameters β1,2,3 and p¯. The values for β1,2,3are determined from the number of adhered bacteria, the distribution of the attached bacteria, and their respective orientation θi [23, 30]. Furthermore, the propulsive force from each bacterium affects the resultant motion. The average of the propulsive force p¯ is 0.45 pN [31].\\n\\nAs a result of previous work [23], the BPM’s movement with a control input can be described by combining the kinematic model with electrokinetic actuation on a global coordinate system, as follows:\\n[VxVyα˙]=Rz(αti−1)[VxLVyLα˙]+∆d(Ux,Uy)/ts=p¯[R(αti−1)00001][β1β2β3]+(UxUy0)β4/ts(2)\\nwhere Rz(θ) is a rotation matrix about z-axis and Δd(Ux, Uy)/ts is the velocity by electokinetic actuation. Herein, we define Ux and Uy are the input voltages for the coordinating mobility, ts is the sampling time. β4 represents the electrophoretic property from the total charge of the attached bacteria.\\n\\nThe motion of the BPM can be represented by parameters β1,2,3, and β4 when the control inputs are presented. In addition, the expected locomotion of a BPM can be calculated with the control input voltages which helps to evaluate the collision risk using this stochastic model.\\n\\n\\nValidation of a BPM model\\n\\nThe stochastic model, as indicated in (2), was validated by simulating the motion after obtaining the necessary parameters β1,2,3 from the experimental data. For this validation, a 40 × 43 μm2 rectangular structure was used in the real experiment and the control input was 20 V/cm on right (+) direction on x-axis.\\n\\nIn order to conduct the simulation, the parameters were obtained by using two motion videos; one is self-actuation motion and the other is electrokinetic motion with 10 V/cm. The position vectors that include Cartesian position and the BPM orientation were utilized after image processing of experiment video. First, the parameter β3 was extracted by calculating the orientation of the BPM without any input, and the value of β3 is 0.38 ± 0.07 rad/(s·pN). Next, the β1 and β2 were calculated while excluding the control input matrix in (2) and were 2.68 ± 3.71 μm/(s·pN) and -3.57 ± 5.28 μm/(s·pN), respectively. Finally, we could get the β4 by substituting the constant control input Ux (10V/cm) in (2), which was 0.17 ± 0.03 μm/(V/cm).\\n\\nIn Fig 2, the simulation result was conducted by the normal distribution of each parameter and compared with the real experimental positions of the BPM with 20 V/cm. The simulated BPM began with the same position as the experimental position. The simulated motion closely corresponded to the experimental consecutive images as shown in Fig 2A with 8.59 ± 1.27 μm errors for the position between simulation and real data (Fig 2B). The error fluctuations between experimental and simulation results are due to the unpredictable behavior of bacteria. In simulation, the kinematic parameters were constant and the accumulated mismatched position between simulations and experiments led to a growth in the standard deviation of error. This result is one of examples; other examples are indicated in previous work [14, 23, 24]. Hence, the kinematic model of the BPMs is validated for developing an obstacle avoidance algorithm in terms of predicting the BPM’s locomotion and calculating the collision risk.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g002Fig 2 Comparison between the real motion of the BPM and the simulation result of the stochastic model.(a)Position of real experimental data and modelling data, (b)Locomotion error between experimental result and simulation result. The scale bar represents 40 μm.\\n\\n\\nDynamic obstacle avoidance strategy\\n\\nIn our previous work [22], the static obstacle avoidance approach based on the dynamic window approach (DWA) [32] was well demonstrated in various environments. In the case of moving obstacles, however, the unpredicted motion of dynamic obstacles can increase the probability of collision. To strengthen the obstacle avoidance algorithm under moving obstacles, the vector field histogram (VFH) method [33] was added in our proposed method.\\n\\n\\nConsidering elements for motion control of BPMs\\n\\nThe natural self-actuated motion of BPMs and the deformation of electric field around obstacles are the two main factors to consider when developing the dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm. The primary concern is related to a bacterial carpet that exhibits self-actuation of a BPM which is naturally induced by flagellar motors. If the control input is not determined by considering the self-actuation of a BPM, there will be a high probability of collision with obstacles. Moreover, the velocity of dynamic obstacles can move relatively fast comparing BPMs and the sudden movement of dynamic obstacles will cause high risk situation. The other consideration is the deformation of an electric field around the obstacle area creating non-uniformities in the potential field. This deformation can be understood by the analog of a river flow around rock where the water flow around the rock is nonlinear and non-uniform. Similarly, the electric field will be distorted around a moving obstacle. This field deformation can lead to undesired motion of the BMP which increases the probability of collision with the moving obstacles. The phenomenon of non-uniform potential field was simulated using a finite element program called COMSOL Multiphysics. In the simulation, the dynamic obstacle was composed of nickel which allow for magnetic actuation and non-permeability as boundary conditions.\\n\\nThe simulation results indicate the distorted range around the moving obstacle over time, as shown in Fig 3. A 10 V/cm electric field was applied in the +x-direction. The triangle object represents a dynamic obstacle with a velocity of 10 μm/s toward the left side from the initial position at 0s (Fig 3). The arrows of electric field deform around the obstacle at 20s (Fig 3C).\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g003Fig 3 COMSOL Multiphysics simulation results of electric field flows.(a)Electric potential flow at 0s, (b)10s, and (c)20s. The triangle represents a moving obstacle that has a nickel material.\\n\\nThe distorted electric field was quantified using the different angle between the desire direction and the direction of electric field. In Fig 4, the streamline indicate the quantity which is normalized from 0 to 1. The larger the value is, the larger the deformation becomes. The non-uniform electric potential region forms ripples which disperse from the dynamic obstacle. Using this profile of the electric field, the formation of distorted area can be utilized in the dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm to ensure a BPM to avoid distorted regions.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g004Fig 4 COMSOL Multiphysics simulation results of distorted electric field area.(a)Non-uniformity of potential field at 0s, (b)10s, and (c)20s. The triangle represents a moving obstacle and the contour values indicate a quantity of distortion for electric field.\\n\\n\\nSuggested approach for dynamic obstacle avoidance\\n\\nOur proposed approach for the development of dynamic obstacle avoidance of BPMs is based on the integration of modified DWA and redefined VFH. We defined four different objective functions in a main function (DWA) to select an optimal control input by considering the parameters listed above, as the BPM approaches a goal position. However, in dynamic environments where moving obstacles are presented, the objective function would not be enough to consider the motion of the dynamic obstacles because the objective function only considers the surrounding environment at a given specific moment. Instead of adding other functions to the objective function, the role of the redefined VFH is to filter out the control inputs with high risk in advance by considering the distance between the BPM and the dynamic obstacles.\\n\\nThe search for control inputs is carried out directly in the space of voltages with–π to +π range of the direction for electric field. In the suggested algorithm, the search space of control inputs depends on the maximum input voltage in the system setup.\\n\\nThere are three steps in the suggested algorithm to determine the commands controlling the BPM. In the first step of the algorithm, the modified VFH function is implemented to restrict the candidate control inputs from the search space when obstacles are located within the safe range as shown in Fig 5A. Even though the distance between the BPM and the obstacle was far initially, if the dynamic obstacle moves close to the BPM at high speed, the BPM might not be able to avoid collision in short time intervals. Therefore, we used the concept of VFH to exclude the motion inputs that drive a BPM toward the valley, occupied by the dynamic obstacles, in vector histogram. The inputs heading for obstacles will have 0 value from the defined VFH function (ν(U, θ)) as follow:\\nθv={θi}forBD(θi)≤saferange,1≤i≤360(3)Tθ=min\\u2061(|θ−θv|),v(U,θ)={0ifTθ≤εsTθ2Tmax2ifεs<Tθ≤Tmax1ifTmax≤Tθ}(4)\\nwhere θv is the group of valley angles in vector histogram, as shown in Fig 5B, Tθ is the minimum gap between the direction of a control input and the angles θv, Function ν(U, θ) represents the distance of the BPM from the valley, and εs is the tolerance used to extend the valley range due to self-actuation. For instance, the angle θ from 23° to 74° has a value of 0 (Fig 5C), thus, these control inputs will be excluded when the VFH is combined with the main objective function.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g005Fig 5 Processing to extract risk control inputs using modified VFH.(a)BPM situated in environment with an obstacle, the pi is the position by input (Ui, θi), (b)The vector histogram of boundary distance within safe range in (a), (c)Contour graph of the VFH function cost.\\n\\nIn the second step, the objective function will be applied to compute the main function (DWA). In the main function (DWA), there are four objective functions: heading, movement, clearance, and control which stand for the quantity value of individual performance (motion direction toward a goal, long movement motion, collision risk, following controllability in sequence). It is given by:\\nf(U,θ)=γ∙heading(U,θ)+δ∙movement(U,θ)+ω∙clearance(U,θ)+σ∙control(U,θ)(5)\\nwhere the U and θ are a magnitude of an admissible voltage and a desired direction of electric field. The function of f is the weighted sum of four components with the weights of γ, δ, ω, and σ.\\n\\nThe concerns mentioned in previous section are accounted for in the clearance and control function. In clearance function, the collision risk from motion of a BPM can be calculated using the kinematic model (2) with control inputs Ux, Uy, (Ux = U·cosθ, Uy = U·sinθ). The control function tends to pick up the control input that enables a BPM to be located at the controllable region (non-distorted regions) where the direction of the generated electric field matches with the direction of the control input. The objective function can lead a BPM to a goal position using the heading function since it enables a BPM to steer towards the goal. To make a BPM move a longer distance, we include the movement function in the objective function.\\n\\nThe sum of each function in (5) will be computed with respect to the position of a BPM, the goal position, and boundary distance information, as shown in Fig 5A. The heading function is to find the most favorable input direction which has the smallest ϕi by calculating the angle at pi in Fig 5A as follows,\\nheading(Ui,θi)=1−ϕiπ(6)\\n\\nA small ϕ means that a BPM is closely aligned to the direct course to the goal. The computed cost is shown in Fig 6A. The θ angle inputs (ranged from 0° to 90°) have the highest cost when the goal is located as shown in Fig 5A. The cost of movement function is given as,\\nmovement(Ui,θi)=β4tsUx2+Uy2/distmax(7)\\nwhere distmax = β4Umax2 is the maximum movement from a maximum input voltage Umax on both axes for one interval. For the movement function, higher voltages have higher costs regardless of θ, as indicated in Fig 6B, because the displacement of a BPM is proportional to the magnitude of an input voltage.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g006Fig 6 Contour graph for calculation for final control input.(a)Result of heading function, (b)Result of movement function, (c)Result of clearance function, (d)Result of control function, (e)Result of the objective function by the sum of all functions from (a-d) before combining VFH cost (Fig 5C), (I1:the chosen control input), (f)Recalculated result after combining VFH cost to (e)(I2: the recalculated control input after combining VFH).\\n\\nComparing with previous work [21, 22], the C-space is not suitable to check the collision in clearance function due to mobility of obstacles and computation time for the dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm. Herein, the boundary distance (BD) from the center of a BPM is used to evaluate the potential risk of collision with obstacles. The instant boundary distance makes it possible to calculate the closest distance between the next expected position of a BPM under the control input and obstacles. The cost of clearance is 1.0 in the collision free case and 0 for a collision as explained in Fig 6C. For the rest of the cases, the cost of clearance is computed as follows,\\nclearance(Ui,θi)=1−BD(θi)−β4Uitssaferange(8)\\n\\nIn case of the control function, it is effective to adapt the gradient profile characterized around an obstacle obtained from the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation (Fig 4). Thus, the control function computes the controllability of a BPM at the determined position by the control inputs (U, θ) as follows,\\ncontrol(Ui,θi)=1−∑deg\\u2061(pi,obstacle)2π(9)\\nwhere the deg function computes how large area has non-uniform electric field gradient from the predicted position of BPM by dynamic obstacles. If the estimated position by the control inputs is near the outside of the distorted gradient boundary, the control function has higher cost. The total resultant cost is depicted in Fig 6D.\\n\\nAfter the objective function is computed as shown in Fig 6E, the last step is to find the optimal control input using\\nInput(U,θ)=max\\u2061({f(Ui,θi)∙v(Ui,θi):1≤i≤M})(10)\\nwhere M is the total number of candidate control inputs. By combining the main objective function f(U, θ) with the function ν(U, θ), our approach can choose the control input which enables a BPM to avoid the approaching obstacles in advance. For instance, the control input I1 in Fig 6E is chosen as a result of using only the objective function. Under this input, the BPM moves toward the obstacle because there is a distance between the BPM and the obstacle. However, if the obstacle is moving fast towards the BMP, there will be a high probability for the BPM to collide with the obstacle under the control input II. On the other hand, the proposed method excludes the occupied input angles that has 0 value in ν(U, θ). As a result, the control input I2 is selected by choosing the highest peak value in Fig 6C. The resultant performance can be different depending on tuning the weighting parameters γ, δ, ω, and σ in (5). In Fig 6A and 6C, the weight values are equal to 0.5.\\n\\nAs a summary, the integrated function will choose the safe control input among the available inputs using the BD data at the instant position of a BPM through implementation of the algorithm in real- time and the BPM moves toward the goal position.\\n\\n\\nDanger index for evaluation of performance\\n\\nIn order to review the performance of the proposed method in different conditions, the danger index was used as an appropriate criterion to evaluate the potential collision risk by the chosen inputs. The danger index is one of general quantitative methods in robotics for safety strategy. To quantify the danger index, there are two elements to evaluate the potential collision risk with obstacles. The first factor is the relative distance between a BPM and obstacles. The distance with obstacles is important to prevent collision events. The BPM can avoid collision as long as the BPM maintains a sufficient distance with obstacles. Thus, we can use the distance information from experiment results to calculate the criteria\\ngD(DBO)={0ifDBO≥Dmaxk(1DBO−1Dmax)ifDBO<Dmax}(11)wherek=DmaxDmin,Dmin=RBPM*kv+dself,kv=V¯obsV¯BPM\\nwhere DBO is the distance between the BPM and the obstacle, Dmin is the minimum allowable distance between the BPM and the obstacle. The Dmin was calculated using the radius of a BPM and the displacement of self-actuated BPM. The parameter kv represents the ratio of average velocity of an obstacle to the average velocity of a BPM.\\n\\nAlthough the given control input enables a BPM to keep away from obstacles, the moving obstacle can intercept and move close to the BPM during experiments. In such a case, however, if the motion control can steer the BPM to escape the area, the collision risk will decrease. Therefore, we regarded the relative angle of the control input as the second factor. The potential risk of the second factor can be evaluated as followed\\ngA(ACO)={0ifACO≥Ablock/2+∆αACOAblock(DBO)/2+∆αifACO<Ablock/2+∆α}(12)\\nwhere ACO is the gap of the angle between the control input direction and the heading angle from the BPM to the center of an obstacle, Ablock is the blocking angle between an obstacle and the center of the BPM. Therefore, if the control input steers a BPM away from the obstacle, the collision risk will become small.\\n\\nThe product-based danger index is then computed as a product of these contributing factors that are scaled:\\ndangerindex=gD(DBO)∙gA(ACO)(13)\\n\\nThe danger index is indicated within the range 0 to 1. A high danger index occurs when both of the distant factor and the relative angle factor have high potential risk. After the data were obtained from experiment results, the danger index was computed with respect to time.\\n\\n\\nExperimental setup\\n\\nThe algorithm was demonstrated with artificial dynamic obstacles that were manually controlled by a user in experiments. The dynamic obstacles were coated with nickel; thus, they were controllable using magnetic fields. Our experimental system consists of a vision system to track a target BPM and to recognize an environment in real-time.\\n\\n\\nPreparation of BPMs & dynamic obstacles\\n\\nTo create BPMs, S. marcescens were attached on the surface of the microfabricated structures with the dimensions of 25 × 20 μm2 and 3 μm thickness. The patterned microstructures were made of SU-8 and there was a dextran sacrificial layer under the structures to release BPMs in the fluids after blotting. More detailed information is in [22] (see S5 File also).\\n\\nFor creating moving obstacles, there were two main steps to fabricate triangular dynamic obstacles. The first step was to use the standard photolithography to make SU-8 bodies of dynamic obstacles. We used chrome mask with equilateral triangle patterns with the length of 43 μm for each side. The triangular dynamic obstacles have a thickness of 3 μm and can be released using a dextran layer, same as the BMPs. To enable magnetic control, Nickel pellets (99.995%, Kurt J.Lesker, PA, USA) were deposited on the structures using chemical vapor deposition at a chamber with a rate of 0.1–0.5 Å/s and pressure of 10−7 torr.\\n\\nAfter depositing a 200 nm nickel film on the top of structures, they were magnetized by placing the structures overnight underneath a permanent neodymium-iron-boron magnet (K&J Magnetics, Pipesville, PA) which has surface field strength of 160.1mT. Before we used the dynamic obstacles in experiment, the magnetized nickel coated obstacles were released in a petri dish that was filled with motility buffer (0.01 M potassium phosphate, 0.067 M sodium chloride, 10−4 M ethylendediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.01 M glucose, pH 7.4). Then, the undamaged magnetic dynamic obstacles were transferred, via micro pipetting, from the petri dish to the experimental chamber where experiments were performed.\\n\\n\\nSystem design for experiment\\n\\nThe experimental system setup is composed of a CMOS camera installed on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX50), an electrokinetic chamber, an electromagnetic coil stage, two power supplies (Ametek XTR 100–8.5) for a BPM, two power supplies (GW INSTEK APS-1102) for dynamic obstacles, an extra power supply for z-coil on stage, and DAQ board (NI DAQ SCB68). Fig 7 shows the experimental setup.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g007Fig 7 Experimental equipment and control strategy.\\n\\nThe electrokinetic chamber is the main workspace where a BPM and nickel coated obstacles were placed. The chamber was located in the center of the electromagnetic coil stage. The electromagnetic coil stage consists of two pairs of electromagnetic coils and connected to two power supplies to generate magnetic fields. To detach the non-movable dynamic obstacles from the bottom surface due to the weight and friction between the glass substrate and SU-8 bodies, the z-coil was applied to generate lift force.\\n\\nIn the experimental chamber, direct current electric fields were generated via agar salt bridges, Steinberg’s solution (60 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 0.3 mM CaNO3·4H2O) and platinum wires (Fig 7). The agar salt bridges were installed to prevent contamination of possible electrode byproducts. Two pairs of platinum wires were fixed in parallel in order to generate electric fields in multiple directions; this allows for the control of a BPM by Ux, Uy on x-axis and y-axis. The control input voltages are determined autonomously by our algorithm. We set the maximum magnitude of the resultant voltage to be 20 V/cm. The chamber was filled with a motility buffer and 0.05% polyethyleneglycol (PEG).\\n\\nManual control of dynamic obstacles was implemented by applying magnetic fields. The strength of the applied magnetic field at the center of the chamber ranges from 1–5 mT; the strength of the field depends on the applied voltage. The velocity of the obstacle was varied depending on the strength of magnetic fields. The input voltage for moving obstacle ranges from 15–20 V. We tried to move obstacles to intercept a BPM by changing the direction of the magnetic field and the magnitude of the input voltage while the BPM approached the goal position in the experiment. The designed obstacles were not manipulated by dielectrophoretic force and it was confirmed through a simple experimental test.\\n\\nA target BPM was traced based on a region detection method using image processing. Once the target BPM was distinguished on the image by tracking algorithm after setting an initial reference position for the BPM, the rest of binary image were used to calculate BD. All image processing and the computation of our algorithm were carried out with a sampling time of 0.16s. The stochastic model parameters β1, β2, β3, and β4 were chosen after observing the motion of the BMP for 2–3 min and then used in the algorithm as constant values.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\nIn experiments, different propertied BPMs were used and the input voltage for dynamic obstacles was changed during the experiments to generate different velocities.\\n\\n\\nSingle dynamic obstacle avoidance\\n\\nIn the first experiment, we demonstrated our suggested obstacle avoidance approach in the environment where there was one moving obstacle. The goal position was chosen manually and located at the opposite side across from the dynamic obstacle in the experiment (see S1 File). The weighting parameters γ, δ, and σ were 0.5 and ω of the clearance function was 0.7 in the objective function. In the case of the stochastic model, the parameters β1, β2, β3, and β4 were determined as ‒6.27, 1.83, 0.02 and 0.61, respectively using the trajectories of the BPM before running the algorithm. The safe range for the redefined v(U, θ) is 80 μm.\\n\\nAfter obtaining all necessary parameters, the BPM was controlled by the proposed approach to reach the goal position without collision, as shown in Fig 8A. A single dynamic obstacle (D1) moves toward the BPM from the initial position at to (red triangle in Fig 8A). At t = 8.96s, the obstacle was moving closer to the BPM, as a result, the BPM was steered away from the obstacle by the computed control inputs. When the BPM passed the obstacle, we changed the moving direction of the obstacle at t4 = 11.20s and returned it to the initial position at t8 = 20.16s. Even though the obstacle was behind the BPM during t4—t8, the algorithm computed the control inputs that allowed the BPM to maintain a sufficient distance from the obstacle. To do so, the control inputs induced a wide curve trajectory to reduce the potential risk by the following obstacle. The determined control input was explained in Fig 8B. The magnitude of the resultant voltage was kept at the maximum value of 20 V/cm for the duration of the experiments.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g008Fig 8 Experimental result of dynamic obstacle avoidance using a single obstacle.(a)Trajectories of the BPM and the dynamic obstacle (D1) (see also S1 File), (b)Control inputs on x-axis and y-axis in experiment.

The scale bar represents 20μm and ti, t*i share the same time.\\n\\nThe velocities of BPM and the obstacle are described in Fig 9A and 9B. The average velocity of the BMP and the obstacle were 21.3 μm/s and 20 μm/s respectively. We steer the obstacle for interception when the BPM moved close to the obstacle.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g009Fig 9 Analysis of experimental result data.(a)The velocity of the BPM, (b)The velocity of the dynamic obstacle (D1), (c)The control input depending on distance between the BPM and D1, with the gap between control input direction and the location angle of D1 from the BPM, (d)Danger index from the gap angle factor function gA(ACO) and the distance factor gD(DBO).\\n\\nThe corresponding control input is plotted based on its angle gap from the heading angle towards D1 from the center of the BPM, and the distance between the BPM and D1 was indicated in Fig 9C. According to Fig 9C, the wide steering control was chosen when the distance between the BPM and D1 was within 190 μm. On the other hand, the control input had a small angle gap with the obstacle when the obstacle was outside of 200 μm distance from the BPM.\\n\\nTo analyze these characteristic of the control inputs with respect to the danger index, gA(ACO) and gD(DBO) were computed as shown in Fig 9D. In the case of gD(DBO), there are several peaks from 13s to 17s due to the high velocity of the obstacle. The value for gA(ACO), on the other hand, was 0 for the entire duration of the experiment. As a result, the product-based danger index (13) is also 0 for the entire experiment which means the corresponding control inputs did not have any potential risks.\\n\\n\\nAvoidance motion under long term disturbance of obstacle\\n\\nIn this experiment, the proposed approach was implemented under longer following obstacle (see S2 File). All required parameters are shown in S1 Table (Exp2). The weight parameter σ had a relative high value compared with other weights. The weight parameters in the movement function have the smallest values. The safe range was 100 μm. The initial positions of the BPM and the dynamic obstacle (D1) were on the right side and the goal is at the left top.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the BPM headed toward the goal with slight upward direction and D1 slowly moved left parallel with the BPM (Fig 10A). The velocity of D1 was increased to 57 μm/s at t3—t4. Then, we tried to make D1 intercept the BPM. The BPM maintained a distance with D1. When D1 stopped at t6, the BPM moved upward to approach the goal. At 27s, D1 was reactivated to intercept the BPM. Thus, the algorithm changes the control inputs to allow the BPM to detour and avoid collision at t9 (Fig 10A). The wide detour trajectory might be caused by the control function and the redefined VFH because the control function has high weight and tends to steer the BPM to empty space. In addition, the v(U,θ) function precludes the BPM from heading to the valley occupied by the obstacle. At the end, the BPM successfully reached the goal location without collision.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g010Fig 10 Experiment of avoiding obstacle following in parallel.(a)Trajectories of the BPM and dynamic obstacle (see also S2 File), (b)Control input voltages on x-axis and y-axis in experiment, (c)Resulting danger index using gap angle factor and distance factor, the scale bar represents 20 μm.\\n\\nThe BPM and the moving obstacle had the average velocities of 16 μm/s and 22 μm/s, respectively. The average distance maintained between the BPM and D1 is 30 μm under the applied control inputs, as shown in Fig 10B. In case of the danger index, the potential risk is computed as shown in Fig 10C. The danger index was low except for the moment when D1 stopped suddenly after it moved close to the BPM. However, after that moment, we can confirm that the algorithm performed safe control motion with lower danger index for 22–37s in Fig 10C. The average danger index is 0.15.\\n\\nCompared with the previous experiment, the dynamic obstacle attempted to intercept the BPM in a manner which presented higher risk for collision. Nonetheless, the algorithm compensated for the higher risk and successfully guided the BMP to avoid the dynamic obstacle.\\n\\n\\nAvoidance motion using strong self-actuated BPMs\\n\\nTo demonstrate the controllability of our algorithm, we conducted several experiments using BPMs with strong self-actuated motion which increase uncertainties in motion control (see S3 File).\\n\\nThe column of ‘Exp3’ in S1 Table indicates all parameters for the algorithm with a safe range of 100 μm. The BPM had a large β3 value which enables the BPM to have a fast angular velocity. Also, the parameters relative to translational motion are large comparing with other cases.\\n\\nThe trajectories of the BPM and the dynamic obstacle (D1) are present in Fig 11A. The BPM started at the right bottom corner and the goal was at the left top corner. During 0–10s, the BPM and the D1 were position far apart. After 10s, the potential risk increased due to closing distance between D1 and the BPM. As the distance becomes smaller at 15s, the strong self-actuated motion began to lead to a higher potential risk compared with the previous experiments, as shown in Fig 11A and 11E. However, the BPM avoided collision due to the control inputs computed using low danger index. While D1 stayed in front of the BPM, the BPM was able to continuously dodge the moving obstacle in real-time. Notably, the BPM was waiting at the right side of the goal area while D1 was occupying the goal location. Once D1 left from the goal location, the BPM went to the goal position from the place where it waited; much like a midfielder passing the defenders to score a goal. All the control inputs are depicted in Fig 11B. Regarding the distance between the BPM and D1 in Fig 11C, the chosen control inputs ranged in the avoiding angle from 19° to 180° and populate around 100°. Even though there was enough distance such as 100–250 μm between the BPM and D1, the control input gave wide spatial motion with the obstacle considering the strong self-actuation in terms of angle.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g011Fig 11 Experiment of using strong self-actuation BPM.(a)Trajectories of the BPM and dynamic obstacle (see also S3 File), (b)The control input voltages in experiment, (c)The control input depending on distance between the BPM and D1, with the gap between control input direction and the location angle of D1 from the BPM, (d)Velocities of the BPM and the dynamic obstacle, (e)Resulting danger index using gap angle factor and distance factor, the scale bar is 20 μm.\\n\\nThe velocity of the BPM and the dynamic obstacle are shown in Fig 11D. Running the obstacle avoidance algorithm, the BPM kept average distances of 62 μm from the obstacle. Due to the time-varying velocity of the obstacle, the given control input induces low values of danger index as explained in Fig 11E. There is no potential risk most of times with an average danger index of 0.23.\\n\\nThrough this experiment, the capability of our suggested approach was examined and verified. This demonstrated safe motion planning of self-actuated BPM in the presence of an aggressive dynamic obstacle.\\n\\n\\nMultiple dynamic obstacle avoidance\\n\\nSo far, our experiments demonstrated dynamic obstacle avoidance using single dynamic obstacle. To ensure that our method is usable with multiple dynamic obstacles, we carried out two experiments, each using two identical dynamic obstacles. Due to the use of a global magnetic field and the motion of the two identical obstacles will be the same. The all parameters are indicated on S1 Table.\\n\\nThe first experiment (Exp4) started with two obstacles positioned at the midpoint between the BPM and the goal location (see S4 File). Fig 12 illustrates the resultant trajectories of the BPM and the two obstacles (D1, D2). Up until 16s, the BPM was moving closer to D1 and D2 as described in Fig 12. When the BPM encountered the nearest obstacle D1, the derived control input avoided the valley placed between the D1 and D2 because the valley was regarded as a dangerous area by clearance function and v(U,θ). Thus, the BPM headed to the upper path and got out of the valley as depicted in Fig 12. We tried to move D1 and D2 backward in order to intercept the BPM again. However, D1 and D2 bonded together due to magnetic force. After their bonding, they moved together as one larger obstacle.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g012Fig 12 Experiment of using multiple obstacles.(see also S4 File). The scale bar represents 20 μm.\\n\\nIn the second case, two obstacles were initially located at separate places. D1 intercepted the BPM’s motion from the bottom side at t1 and t3 as illustrated in Fig 13. After the BPM cleared D1 by moving downward, D2 came down from the top to attempt an interception. After 52s (t8), D2 was within the range to present a potential risk. The BPM could not approach the goal location because the D2 occupied the goal area. When D2 moved away from the goal, the BPM was rotating around the region at t10—t12 and eventually reach the goal position.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g013Fig 13 Experiment of using multiple obstacles.The scale bar represents 20 μm.\\n\\nThe danger indexes for each obstacle were calculated (Fig 14). Fig 14A shows the danger index of the first case. There was low a potential risk due to the wide detour path planning to avoid the valley. Similarly, in the second case, the danger index was below 0.7 while the BPM avoided D1 and D2 (Fig 14B). Comparing to the first case, the second case has greater danger index.\\n\\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185744.g014Fig 14 Computation of danger index.(a)Resulting danger index using the gap angle factor and the distance factor with D1, D2 in Fig 12, (b)Resulting danger index using the gap angle factor and the distance factor with D1,D2 in Fig 13.\\n\\nIn this experiment, we show that our autonomous motion strategy can guide a BPM to avoid the interference from multiple dynamic obstacles and compute a safe trajectory to the target position.\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThe dynamic obstacle avoidance approach was demonstrated by successfully guiding BPMs to avoid multiple nickel coated dynamic obstacles. To successfully implement the algorithm in experiments, we took into account the uncontrollable motion of BPMs and the distorted electric field near the obstacles. Our suggested objective function includes four functions for extracting optimal control inputs. The sub functions of the objective function are heading, movement, clearance, and control. The algorithm determines the safe motion control input that maximizes four performance categories—goal arrival, no collision, speed, and controllability. The exerted control inputs are selected from the admissible control input window during a sampling time. Instead of adding other functions to the objective function, the redefined VFH concept is utilized to eliminate control inputs which may lead to collision.\\n\\nFive experiments have been executed in different setup with various circumstances. Moreover, we used strong self-actuated BPMs in experiments in order to evaluate the robustness of the control system. Our proposed approach allows the target BPMs to arrive at the goal positions without collision with single or multiple dynamic obstacles. To evaluate the performance of each result motion, the danger index was applied to compare the potential risk caused by the chosen control input. The danger index is computed using two factors that are how much the control input can steer the BPM from the obstacle and what is the distance between the BPM and obstacles. Through danger-evaluation method, we can quantify the performance of the results in terms of safety.

Fluvial-lacustrine environments associated with basaltic volcanism are highly relevant to Mars, but their terrestrial counterparts have been largely overlooked as a field analogue. Such environments are common in Iceland, where basaltic volcanism interacts with glacial ice and surface snow to produce large volumes of meltwater within an otherwise cold and dry environment. This meltwater can be stored to create subglacial, englacial, and proglacial lakes, or be released as catastrophic floods and proglacial fluvial systems. Sedimentary deposits produced by the resulting fluvial-lacustrine activity are extensive, with lithologies dominated by basaltic minerals, low-temperature alteration assemblages (e.g., smectite clays, calcite), and amorphous, poorly crystalline phases (basaltic glass, palagonite, nanophase iron oxides). This paper reviews examples of these environments, including their sedimentary deposits and microbiology, within the context of utilising these localities for future Mars analogue studies and instrument testing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mars</kwd><kwd>lacustrine</kwd><kwd>fluvial</kwd><kwd>volcanism</kwd><kwd>habitability</kwd><kwd>Iceland</kwd><kwd>astrobiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>1. Introduction</title><p>As our search for Martian habitability progresses, so does our understanding of past environments and surface processes on Mars. From the &#x0201c;follow the water&#x0201d; approach employed by NASA during the Mars Exploration Rover and Phoenix missions, Mars exploration has since become focused on the identification of &#x0201c;habitability&#x0201d; and the detection of potential biosignatures [<xref rid=\"B1-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>,<xref rid=\"B2-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. One of the greatest shifts in our understanding of Mars surface geology has been the identification of widespread alteration minerals through orbital data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) and Observatoire pour la Min&#x000e9;ralogie, l&#x02019;Eau, les Glaces et l&#x02019;Activit&#x000e9; (OMEGA) instruments [<xref rid=\"B3-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>,<xref rid=\"B4-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>,<xref rid=\"B5-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>], complimenting pre-existing morphological evidence for hydrological surface activity throughout the Noachian and into the Hesperian [<xref rid=\"B6-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>]. The global distribution of these deposits implies that aqueous processes and environments were active across much of the planet, resulting from a range of possible scenarios including climatic hydrological cycles, punctuated episodes of hydrological activity initiated by localised cryospheric melting, release of pressurized subsurface water aquifers, and isolated volcanic and impact events [<xref rid=\"B6-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>,<xref rid=\"B7-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>,<xref rid=\"B8-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>]. The nature of habitability on Mars is therefore underpinned by these processes at both spatial and temporal scales, and includes the availability of bioessential elements, metabolic redox couples, and stability and longevity of liquid water environments [<xref rid=\"B9-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>,<xref rid=\"B10-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. The expansive and diverse sedimentary record on Mars ranges from open and closed basin systems to rhythmite deposits putatively linked to climatic cycles, all of which have yet to be definitively explained but provide a record of potentially habitable palaeoenvironments [<xref rid=\"B11-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]. Deltaic fan deposits for example, particularly those thought to have been deposited within a stable lacustrine setting, such as the Jezero crater open-basin lake system [<xref rid=\"B12-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>], suggest long-lived liquid water environments. Conversely, recent experimental work suggests many delta fans on Mars formed during short, intense episodes of high hydrological discharge [<xref rid=\"B13-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>]. Extensive networks of branching fluvial channels (predominantly Noachian terrains) and large outflow flood channels (predominantly late Hesperian terrains) also characterize the Martian surface [<xref rid=\"B14-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. Continued valley formation into the early Amazonian has been identified, with the youngest valleys thought to be related to hydrothermalism due to their confinement to volcanic constructs [<xref rid=\"B15-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>]. Similarly, alternating episodes of aqueous flooding and volcanism identified at Mangala Valles potentially indicate a causational relationship between the two, with evidence for repeated and interacting subsurface igneous and hydrological events occurring into the Late Amazonian [<xref rid=\"B16-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>]. Recently, [<xref rid=\"B17-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>] demonstrated the potential for short periods of global climatic warming instigated by episodic flood volcanism throughout the Noachian and Hesperian, which would result in temporary melting of surface ice and snow and the generation of fluvial and lacustrine systems.</p><p>Understanding the cause and characteristics of these aqueous environments for astrobiology is challenging, but regardless of their interpretation, the deposits of such fluvial and lacustrine settings are currently a major target in continued robotic exploration of Mars, including the continued exploration of Gale Crater by Mars Science Laboratory and ongoing site-selection for the ESA ExoMars 2018 rover mission. Therefore, identifying which microbial metabolisms are supported by episodic, basalt-hosted fluvial-lacustrine systems can inform what biosignatures to search for, and how well rover instrumentation fares when deployed on such deposits. Likewise, understanding the preservation and detection of organic carbon and other &#x0201c;ingredients&#x0201d; of habitability within phyllosilicate- and sulfate-bearing sedimentary deposits that are mineralogically and geochemically analogous to those on Mars is imperative to continued successful exploration. Clay-bearing lithologies have been identified as particularly important targets for the detection of preserved organic matter [<xref rid=\"B18-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>]. On Earth, plate tectonics combined with continual surface and suboceanic weathering results in a complex and evolved clay cycle, whereby neoformed and inherited clays are deposited within a variety of active- and passive-margin sedimentary basins and subsequently buried, transformed through diagenetic and metamorphic processes, and recycled [<xref rid=\"B19-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The lack of plate tectonics on Mars will most likely result in different pathways for clay formation and deposition [<xref rid=\"B20-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>], with the dominance of Fe/Mg clay deposits over Al-rich phyllosilicates consistent with the alteration of basaltic crust at low water/rock ratios [<xref rid=\"B20-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]. This is consistent with basaltic crust being particularly susceptible to alteration and clay mineral formation due to the low-temperature instability of basaltic mineral phases, and the amorphous nature of any basaltic glass produced via eruptive products at the surface (<italic>i.e.</italic>, lava flows, ash). Therefore, terrestrial environments typified by neoformed, authigenic clays (e.g., volcanogenic and hydrothermal clays, and clays directly precipitated from solution) and detrital inherited clays that have undergone little thermal transformation [<xref rid=\"B19-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] are useful analogues to clays on Mars. Furthermore, where such clays on Earth form and are deposited in association with environments typified by relatively low biomass, there is scope to establish how biogenic organic matter may be preserved.</p><p>Sedimentary systems that exist within polar and high altitude environments are of use to Mars analogue research due to the minimal influence from vegetation, organic-rich surface soils, and anthropogenic activity. Alluvial fans in the Atacama Desert [<xref rid=\"B21-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>], debris flows in Alaska [<xref rid=\"B22-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>], and impact crater lake sedimentation [<xref rid=\"B23-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>] and saline springs [<xref rid=\"B24-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>] within the Canadian High Arctic have similarly been used or proposed as Mars analogues, and have provided important constraints as to the nature of comparable processes on Mars. However, a fundamental difference between the mineralogical products of alteration and weathering and the resulting sedimentary deposits is the relatively evolved, Si-Al rich nature of the Earth&#x02019;s crust compared to the Fe-Mg rich crust of Mars [<xref rid=\"B25-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>] Initial results from the first four rocks examined by the NASA Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity revealed three of the four rocks to be volcaniclastic sediments of igneous origin, with a broadly basaltic composition [<xref rid=\"B26-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>], while sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay were also derived from sources compositionally consistent with basaltic crust [<xref rid=\"B27-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>], including detrital mafic minerals (e.g., Fe-forsterite, plagioclase, pigeonite, and augite) within the sediments [<xref rid=\"B28-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. This is unsurprising given the largely basaltic composition of the Martian crust [<xref rid=\"B29-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>], and likely to be a factor for other fluvial-lacustrine systems beyond those explored in Gale Crater. Indeed, some areas of extensive alteration on Mars have been interpreted as long-term aqueous interaction with basaltic crust [<xref rid=\"B6-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>] such as through low temperature, neutral pH hydrothermalism [<xref rid=\"B30-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>], high temperature acid fumarole alteration [<xref rid=\"B31-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>], or impact-generated hydrothermalism [<xref rid=\"B32-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>]. Therefore, when using terrestrial-based analogues for fluvial and lacustrine environments on Mars, it is imperative that future instrument testing and biosignature research includes similar basalt-derived sedimentary lithologies. For example, the utility of low-temperature alteration assemblages within the basaltic Deccan Traps, India, as an analogue for Al-phyllosilicate and Fe/Mg smectite stratigraphy on Mars has been previously demonstrated [<xref rid=\"B33-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>2. Iceland</title><p>The volcanic island of Iceland is unique in that its volcanotectonic setting lies at a juxtaposed mantle plume and rift system [<xref rid=\"B34-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>] within a near-arctic location. This volcanotectonic setting results in the crust having a broadly basaltic composition (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f001\">Figure 1</xref>), with tholeiitic eruptive products reflecting these two main magmatic sources within the active rift zone [<xref rid=\"B35-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>,<xref rid=\"B36-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>]. Overall, the majority of Holocene basalts comprise three dominant magma series from tholeiitic, transitional alkalic, to alkalic [<xref rid=\"B35-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>,<xref rid=\"B36-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>], with Pleistocene basalts (predominantly subglacially-erupted pillow lavas and volcaniclastics, and interglacial lavas) exhibiting much the same trend [<xref rid=\"B36-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>,<xref rid=\"B37-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">37</xref>]. This provides excellent examples of volcanogenic fluvial&#x02013;lacustrine terrains, deposits, and environments where the primary crust and sediment parent material is basaltic in composition. The combination of Fe-Mg rich and Al-Si poor crust with aqueous environments that are locally influenced by elevated sulfur input due to their proximity to (or interaction with) volcanic activity make these sites valuable field models for detrital and authigenic mineral assemblages and the biosignatures deposited and potentially preserved.</p><fig id=\"life-05-00568-f001\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Total Alkali Silica plot adapted from [<xref rid=\"B29-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] TES = Thermal Emission Spectrometer, GRS = Gamma Ray Spectrometer and including MSL Curiosity APXS data (Tables S1&#x02013;S3, from [<xref rid=\"B26-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>]; Table 7 from [<xref rid=\"B27-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]) and supplementary data (* marked) from [<xref rid=\"B35-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>].

As such, an estimated 60% of Icelandic glaciers overlie active volcanic systems [<xref rid=\"B38-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. This interaction between active volcanism along the neovolcanic zone and surface ice over the past 0.8 Ma [<xref rid=\"B34-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>] has resulted in widespread volcaniclastic sedimentation, including ubiquitous hyaloclastite/hyalotuff sequences, volcanogenic fluvial and lacustrine environments, and crustal hydrothermal alteration (both low and high temperature). Furthermore, many deposits and ongoing active environments are relatively undisturbed or reworked by vegetation, fauna, or human influence, particularly along the active rift zone (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f002\">Figure 2</xref>B). Moreover, these regions are also specific analogues for putative glaciovolcanic landforms on Mars (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B39-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]), which may represent one of the few habitable environments that could have pervaded into the Amazonian [<xref rid=\"B39-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>,<xref rid=\"B40-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>].

Iceland is a well-known locality for Mars analogue research, including aqueous alteration of basaltic crust [<xref rid=\"B43-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref>] and gully formation [<xref rid=\"B44-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>]. Volcaniclastic sedimentary terrains and the fluvial-lacustrine processes that modify them have been largely overlooked, although comparisons have been made previously between subglacial outflow events (&#x0201c;j&#x000f6;kulhlaups&#x0201d;) and flood channels on Mars [<xref rid=\"B45-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>], and a study by [<xref rid=\"B46-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>] demonstrated the utility of low temperature alteration phases within Icelandic basaltic outwash sediments as a good analogue for detecting similar assemblages on Mars. This paper provides a synthesis of example sedimentary fluvial-lacustrine terrains and contemporary active lacustrine environments in Iceland, with the view to present these as new and currently underused analogues for similar habitats and deposits on Mars, particularly with relevance to habitability and biosignature detection. As such, the aim of this paper is not to provide a direct geomorphological or formational analogue to specific terrains on Mars, but to expand the current variety of terrestrial localities which are of benefit to ongoing and future robotic exploration of Mars.</p><fig id=\"life-05-00568-f002\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map of Iceland showing the location of the sites covered in this paper.

Lacustrine Environments</title><p>Lakes in glacial settings can form as a direct result of volcanic activity, where ice is converted to water by an increase in geothermal heat, forming englacial (glacier-bound), supraglacial (occurring at the glacier surface), and subglacial (occurring beneath the glacier) lakes. Because glacier margins themselves can also be sites of lacustrine activity (e.g., proglacial lakes), there is a complex interrelationship between volcanic episodes, lake evolution, and the resulting sedimentary products [<xref rid=\"B47-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref>]. The volcanogenic glaciolacustrine environments detailed here result from the direct interaction between either a central volcano or hydrothermal vents and overlying ice [<xref rid=\"B48-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref>]. They range from active subglacial lakes at Gr&#x000ed;msv&#x000f6;tn and Skaft&#x000e1;, and englacial hydrothermal lakes at Kverkfj&#x000f6;ll, to glaciolacustrine sedimentary deposits north of Br&#x000fa;arj&#x000f6;kull.</p><sec><title>3.1.

Of these volcanic systems, Gr&#x000ed;msv&#x000f6;tn has been regularly active, producing recent eruptions in 1996 (Gj&#x000e1;lp), 1998, 2004 and 2011. The eruption observed in 1996 at Gj&#x000e1;lp was entirely subglacial, resulting in meltwater ponding beneath the ice cap [<xref rid=\"B50-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">50</xref>]. This process is common at volcano-ice interaction sites, with ongoing heat flux often maintaining a subglacial meltwater lake in between eruptions [<xref rid=\"B51-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">51</xref>]. Several investigations have been conducted into the biogeochemical environment and indigenous microbiology of the subglacial lakes at Gr&#x000ed;msv&#x000f6;tn and at the nearby Skaft&#x000e1; lakes beneath Vatnaj&#x000f6;kull. In 2004 [<xref rid=\"B52-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">52</xref>] sampled the subglacial lake confined within the Gr&#x000ed;msv&#x000f6;tn crater ~300 m beneath the ice surface and identified a viable microbial community residing within the lake. Results showed the &#x02212;0.2 &#x000b0;C, oxic, mildly acidic (pH 4.87&#x02013;5.13) lake supported a community of psychrotolerant bacteria, distinct from bacterial communities within the surrounding ice and snow, that was well adapted to a glacial environment. In contrast, the nearby geothermal subglacial lake at Western Skaft&#x000e1; forms a warmer (3.5&#x02013;6 &#x000b0;C) anerobic environment within its bottom waters, with a measureable input of hydrothermal fluids into the lake [<xref rid=\"B53-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">53</xref>].

Englacial Lakes</title><p>Ice-bound englacial lakes sustained by hydrothermal activity provide a subaerial counterpart to the subglacial lakes detailed above, which are more readily accessible for sampling and research. Hydrothermal input into these lakes includes active hot springs and fumaroles within and around the shore of the lake [<xref rid=\"B56-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">56</xref>]. At the Kverkfj&#x000f6;ll volcano on the northern margin of Vatnaj&#x000f6;kull, the ~300 m diameter englacial hydrothermal lake Kverkfjallal&#x000f3;n, locally also named Gengissig, is sustained by geothermal heating in between periodic drainage events, the most recent of which occurred in August 2013, producing a small j&#x000f6;kulhlaup following a phreatic event [<xref rid=\"B57-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">57</xref>]. Geothermal heating of this lake keeps it seasonally ice-free (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f004\">Figure 4</xref>a), with summertime (June 2011) temperatures between 10&#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C at the lake shore [<xref rid=\"B41-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>]. The microbiology from one sample taken at 4 m depth within this lake was found to be dominated almost entirely by the aerobic betaproteobacterium <italic>Xenophilus</italic>, a microorganism common to glacial environments [<xref rid=\"B55-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">55</xref>]. However, for elucidating comparable metabolisms that could have operated within Martian lacustrine environments, where only anaerobic metabolisms are likely to have been feasible, englacial subaerial lakes such as Kverkfjallal&#x000f3;n benefit from hydrothermal input, which results in localized anoxia or reduced dissolved oxygen (DO) at points of direct hydrothermal interaction or mixing, contrasting with the oxic areas of the lake. For example, DO at the lake edge measured in 2011 ranged from 0.8&#x02013;3.9 mg/L [<xref rid=\"B41-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>]. Coupled with the availability of dissolved sulfate [<xref rid=\"B41-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>] (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f003\">Figure 3</xref>), this provides a natural laboratory within which to investigate anaerobic chemolithotrophy within a lacustrine setting as a model for past Martian ecosystems. Indeed, glaciovolcanic landforms at Arsia Mons suggest that such an englacial lake was sustained through volcanic heating, potentially for hundreds to thousands of years [<xref rid=\"B39-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Adjacent to Kverkfjallal&#x000f3;n is a younger ice-dammed lake (locally termed &#x0201c;Galtarl&#x000f3;n&#x0201d;). This clear blue lake (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f004\">Figure 4</xref>c) has not yet been investigated with regards to its resident biota, but the clarity of the lake water suggests this environment will be highly nutrient limited, similar to supraglacial lakes observed on Greenlandic ice sheets [<xref rid=\"B58-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">58</xref>]. These lakes represent low temperature hydrothermal lacustrine environments, with geochemical inputs driven by passive leaching of bioessential dissolved ions (e.g., Si, Ca, Na, Fe, Mg) from the underlying basaltic bedrock, mixing with hydrothermal fluids draining into the lake [<xref rid=\"B41-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>,<xref rid=\"B53-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">53</xref>], and by active volcanic degassing of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, and H<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid=\"B56-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">56</xref>]. One major factor that may have differed between englacial lakes on Earth and lacustrine environments on Mars is the potential presence of sustained ice cover on Martian lakes, and the effect of this on sunlight and delivery of exogenous nutrients. However, given that phototrophy has not been identified as the primary means of production within the indigenous microbial communities present within Kverkfjallal&#x000f3;n [<xref rid=\"B55-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">55</xref>], and that both Kverkfjallal&#x000f3;n and nearby Galtarl&#x000f3;n typically lose their ice-cover predominantly during summer months (and some years not at all, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f004\">Figure 4</xref>c,d), which has the benefit of improving accessibility for sampling, this difference does not detract from the value of these sites as a suitable microbial analogue.</p><p>Sediments sampled from Kverkfjallal&#x000f3;n and nearby lake shore areas in June 2011 were found to comprise of detrital plagioclase and pyroxene sourced from the underlying basalt, and alteration phases including smectite clays, gypsum, jarosite, pyrite, heulandite, and quartz [<xref rid=\"B41-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>]. This combination of unaltered basaltic minerals and low temperature alteration phases is analogous to sediments (although not the depositional environment) explored by the MSL Curiosity rover at Yellowknife Bay, which included detrital basaltic minerals, smectites, calcium sulfates, iron oxide or hydroxides, iron sulfides, and amorphous material [<xref rid=\"B28-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. Englacial lake sediments can be emplaced in the sedimentary record via repeated jokulhlaup events, such as the jokulhlaup sandur deposits identified in the proglacial region of Kverkfj&#x000f6;ll [<xref rid=\"B59-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">59</xref>] and described in <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"sec4-life-05-00568\">Section 4</xref> below.

Proglacial Lacustrine Environments</title><p>Unlike subglacial and englacial lakes, proglacial lakes can be the focus of significant sediment deposition, but may lack the hydrothermal input required to sustain a variety of chemolithotrophic metabolisms.

Meltwater stored within the glacier drained sub- and supra-glacially into G&#x000ed;gj&#x000f6;kulsl&#x000f3;n, producing two prograding ice-contact sediment fans (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f004\">Figure 4</xref>b,e). Further outbursts of meltwater occurred, completely infilling G&#x000ed;gj&#x000f6;kulsl&#x000f3;n, followed by &#x0003e;140 smaller outburst floods, attributed to continued subglacial melt at the eruption site and beneath G&#x000ed;gj&#x000f6;kull glacier [<xref rid=\"B60-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">60</xref>]. Together, these events resulted in a depositional fan of varying steepness emanating from a bedrock gorge (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f004\">Figure 4</xref>e). The j&#x000f6;kulhlaups were sediment rich, draining much of the subglacially-erupted volcanic material [<xref rid=\"B61-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">61</xref>] with the majority of deposition estimated to occur over a short time frame of ~48 h [<xref rid=\"B60-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">60</xref>]. Such deposits provide an example of primary, organically-poor basaltic sediment fans that have undergone little aqueous alteration or transport.</p><p>The emplacement of volcanic edifices and subsequent localised increase in elevation can also lead to the natural damming of glacial meltwater and subsequent formation of a proglacial lake during glacial retreat. An example of this can be seen in the Pleistocene sedimentary record within the proglacial region of Br&#x000fa;arj&#x000f6;kull. Here, a palaeolake damned by the subglacially erupted pillow basalt and volcaniclastic edifice of K&#x000e1;rahn&#x000fa;kar became progressively in-filled with lacustrine and deltaic sediments during deglaciation in the Quaternary [<xref rid=\"B62-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">62</xref>]. These proglacial lacustrine sediments at originated from subaqueous fan and low-angle delta environments, and are now partly exposed along the J&#x000f6;kuls&#x000e1; &#x000e1; Br&#x000fa; from the current margin of Br&#x000fa;arj&#x000f6;kull. Following deposition of these lacustrine sequences, fluvial channels have since cut into these sediments, thought to result from the lake dam being breached [<xref rid=\"B62-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">62</xref>]. Lacustrine and glaciofluvial sedimentary sequences formed during glacial retreat also exist along the nearby Flj&#x000f3;tsdalur and J&#x000f6;kuldalur valleys in East Iceland [<xref rid=\"B63-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">63</xref>], which channelled ice flow over successive glaciations [<xref rid=\"B64-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">64</xref>]. This process of sedimentation forms a temporal contrast to the rapid sediment formation and deposition observed during j&#x000f6;kulhlaup release into a lake, as observed at G&#x000ed;gj&#x000f6;kulsl&#x000f3;n. These sites therefore contain a sedimentary record depicting a range of depositional lacustrine environments. There is an absence of a clay component here, even within the fine-grained sediment units [<xref rid=\"B63-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">63</xref>]. While this limits this site for analogue work focusing on those lacustrine environments on Mars that exhibit phyllosilicate spectral signatures, it is more applicable to the majority of paleolake systems on Mars that do not show this evidence for alteration minerals [<xref rid=\"B65-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">65</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"sec4-life-05-00568\"><title>4.

Moreover, geothermal and meltwater dissolution of glass-rich basaltic tephra releases elements into these meltwaters, enabling the delivery of biologically-limiting elements (e.g., phosphorous and iron) into the surrounding proglacial environment [<xref rid=\"B66-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">66</xref>]. For example, the 1996 j&#x000f6;kulhlaup originating from the subglacial eruption at Gj&#x000e1;lp had an estimated dissolved volatile and element load of 1 million tonnes [<xref rid=\"B67-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">67</xref>,<xref rid=\"B68-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">68</xref>], with suspended sediments comprising fresh glass, palagonite (amorphous primary product of basaltic glass alteration), alteration minerals (such as zeolite and calcite), plagioclase, augite, and olivine, and rock fragments [<xref rid=\"B67-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">67</xref>]. This meltwater generated by the Gj&#x000e1;lp eruption had a pH ranging between 3 and 8 at the eruption site, with the resulting flood water pH ranging from 6.88 to 7.95 [<xref rid=\"B68-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">68</xref>]. J&#x000f6;kulhlaups from M&#x000fd;rdalsj&#x000f6;kull and Vatnaj&#x000f6;kull in 2011 were also found to have alkaline-neutral pH waters [<xref rid=\"B66-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">66</xref>], with increased levels of dissolved organic carbon, formate, and acetate observed within the M&#x000fd;rdalsj&#x000f6;kull j&#x000f6;kulhlaup, which suggests microbiological activity was present within the subglacial meltwater stored beneath M&#x000fd;rdalsj&#x000f6;kull prior to its catastrophic release [<xref rid=\"B66-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">66</xref>].

Such repeated deposition of subglacially-sourced sediment provides a contemporary analogue to the transport and burial of subglacially-sourced organics derived from the geothermally-driven microbial communities present with the subglacial caldera lakes. While the vast majority of fluvial sediments on Mars are not j&#x000f6;kulhlaup deposits, the utility of these Icelandic sites for Mars analogue research lies in their connectivity to lacustrine environments typified by chemolithotrophic and/or oligotrophic microbial communities, mafic mineralogy and related alteration phases, and subsequent deposition within cold and dry basaltic terrains.</p><p>Further to the south of Vatnaj&#x000f6;kull, the Skei&#x000f0;ar&#x000e1;rsandur proglacial sediments form the largest active outwash plain in the world [<xref rid=\"B38-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>], and as such record an extensive history of fluvial-lacustrine sedimentary deposition throughout the Holocene.

Glaciolacustrine lithofacies encompass interbedded silts and fine sand and rippled silt layers.

Sediments exposed along the G&#x000ed;gjukv&#x000ed;sl river have already been used for Mars analogue work investigating the utility of hand-lens imager type datasets (e.g., similar to data produced by the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) on NASA&#x02019;s MSL Curiosity rover) in characterizing sedimentary grain size and morphology, from which fluvial palaeoflows and processes can be interpreted [<xref rid=\"B71-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">71</xref>]. Fluvial conglomerates comprising of cemented rounded pebbles have since been identified on Mars by the MSL Curiosity rover, providing the first <italic>in situ</italic> evidence of fluvial sedimentary deposition, most likely as part of a distal alluvial fan deposit [<xref rid=\"B72-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">72</xref>].</p><p>Successions of fluvial sedimentation can also be found at S&#x000f3;lheimaj&#x000f6;kull (a small outlet glacier of the larger M&#x000fd;rdalsj&#x000f6;kull ice cap) and Kverkj&#x000f6;kull (a small outlet glacier near Kverkfj&#x000f6;ll, on the northern margin of Vatnaj&#x000f6;kull). At S&#x000f3;lheimaj&#x000f6;kull (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f005\">Figure 5</xref>b), a j&#x000f6;kulhlaup occurred in 1999 following volcanic activity at Katla subglacial volcano, and included meltwater transport both supraglacially, and along the glacier bed, and temporary meltwater storage within ice-marginal basins [<xref rid=\"B73-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">73</xref>]. J&#x000f6;kulhlaup sedimentation within the glacier produced esker ridges and a large fan at the glacier snout [<xref rid=\"B73-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">73</xref>] and deposits of fine (clay&#x02013;silt or finer) sediment on the glacier surface. Glacial retreat since the event has exposed an esker bearing two depositional units: well-sorted cross-stratified gravels and a poorly sorted boulder unit [<xref rid=\"B73-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">73</xref>]. Glaciofluvial eskers have been proposed to explain many of the sinuous ridges on Mars [<xref rid=\"B74-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">74</xref>], potentially in association with glaciaolacustrine deposits [<xref rid=\"B74-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">74</xref>]. At Kverkj&#x000f6;kull (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f005\">Figure 5</xref>c), there are a number of active fluvial environments and associated sedimentary and mineralogical deposits. Within the proglacial region of Kverkj&#x000f6;kull, 3 km of sedimentary sections within a fluvially-incised sedimentary fan records at least six volcanogenic j&#x000f6;kulhlaup events [<xref rid=\"B59-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">59</xref>]. This sandur comprises several distinctive lithofacies, including (in order of decreasing grainsize) poorly sorted clast- and matrix-supported boulder-gravel facies, a clast-supported gravel unit that dominates the sedimentary section, a pebble-granule-gravel facies with well-defined bedding planes, and finally a sand facies comprising thin (&#x0003c;1 cm) sand layers which form boundary layers between gravel beds [<xref rid=\"B59-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">59</xref>]. As with the sedimentary sections at G&#x000ed;gjukv&#x000ed;sl, these deposits provide an ideal site for testing robotic instrumentation and biosignature preservation on basaltic sediments within a largely vegetation-free terrain (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f005\">Figure 5</xref>c). The Kverkj&#x000f6;kull proglacial environment also includes the river Volga, a meltwater stream of subglacial origin with variable hydrothermal input from the Kverkfjoll high temperature geothermal areas [<xref rid=\"B56-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">56</xref>]. This CO<sub>2</sub>-sulfate fluvial environment contrasts to the CO<sub>2</sub>-sulfide dominated subglacial lacustrine environments under Vatnaj&#x000f6;kull (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"life-05-00568-f003\">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, to the east of Kverkfj&#x000f6;ll lies the geothermal river Hveragil, a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich carbonate-depositing neutral-alkaline stream [<xref rid=\"B41-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>,<xref rid=\"B56-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">56</xref>].</p><fig id=\"life-05-00568-f005\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Examples of proglacial fluvial environments and sedimentary deposits.

Conclusions</title><p>The environments and depositional settings detailed within this paper can both sustain and potentially preserve evidence of Mars-analogue psychrophilic or chemolithotrophic microbial communities. These basaltic sedimentary lithologies produced through fluvial and lacustrine action, much of which is volcanogenic itself, can serve as a broad analogue for fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary terrains on Mars, particularly where discrete sedimentary deposits containing alteration phases lie within predominantly basaltic terrain. In addition, these sites also act as specific glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial systems.</p><p>With relevance to the preservation and detection of organic material within fluvial-lacustrine sediments, the glaciovolcanic lacustrine systems outlined here can serve as a model as to how well organic matter can be preserved within environments with low biological productivity, and, at least for the active systems, where primary production is predominantly driven by chemolithoautotrophy rather than phototrophy. In addition, given the necessity to confidently distinguish between authigenic and detrital clay (and other alteration) minerals via <italic>in situ</italic> exploration [<xref rid=\"B20-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>], such sites can be used to test the interpretation of data products acquired from future prototypes and breadboard instruments, where both authigenic (e.g., glaciovolcanic hydrothermal lakes) and detrital alteration minerals (e.g., fluvial sediments) can be investigated within a connected system (<italic>i.e.</italic>, tracing mineral formation and transport from source to sink). A summary of site-specific analogue science is summarized in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"life-05-00568-t001\">Table 1</xref>. For example, the sedimentary stratigraphic exposures at G&#x000ed;gj&#x000f6;kulsl&#x000f3;n, Br&#x000fa;arj&#x000f6;kull proglacial region, and Kverkj&#x000f6;kull lend themselves well to field-testing imaging instrumentation in particular, where the scientific objectives are to incorporate geological context and palaeoenvironmental interpretation of lithologies from wide-angle, high resolution, 2D and 3D image data. This is especially true when geomorphological features are important in assessing past habitability, such as grain size, roundness, and sorting (e.g., [<xref rid=\"B72-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">72</xref>]). Likewise, the assessment of palaeohabitability from rover- or lander-based remote sensing datasets such as those produced by Pancam/Mastcam, MAHLI, and ChemCam instruments [<xref rid=\"B75-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">75</xref>] can be fine-tuned at such sites where specific stratigraphic horizons may need to be targeted (e.g., when searching for biosignatures) within sedimentary exposures comprising different lithofacies. For example fluvial sediments deposited along the Skaft&#x000e1; river during the periodic catastrophic draining of the Skaft&#x000e1; subglacial lakes would be an ideal target to test for the preservation of organic carbon fixed by the chemolithotrophic communities residing within the subglacial lakes of Vatnaj&#x000f6;kull, while glaciolacustrine and fluvial stratigraphy within the Br&#x000fa;arj&#x000f6;kull proglacial region and the Flj&#x000f3;tsdalur and J&#x000f6;kuldalur valleys can be used for testing spectroscopic instrumentation and the detection of discrete mineralogical horizons. To this end, given the range of grainsize, sedimentary fabrics, and mineralogy present within different fluvial and lacustrine lithofacies sourced predominantly from basaltic protoliths, the preservation of organics as a function of depositional time (<italic>i.e.</italic>, rapid, slow), grainsize (<italic>i.e.</italic>, fine or coarse), and mineralogy (<italic>i.e.</italic>, detrital basalt or alteration phases) warrants investigation. The same applies to inorganic biosignatures, such as stable isotope fractionation values of sulfur produced through microbial sulfur reduction and preserved by sedimentary pyrite grains within lacustrine sediments [<xref rid=\"B41-life-05-00568\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the range of coarse to fine-grained lithologies at all these sites make these them suitable for testing sampling and sample manipulation instrumentation (such as corers, scoops, drills, grinders, sieves and crushers), particularly where instruments have to cope with a local mixture of different grainsize and matrix components. In this sense, large-scale sites at G&#x000ed;gj&#x000f6;kulsl&#x000f3;n and the proglacial regions of Br&#x000fa;arj&#x000f6;kull and Kverkj&#x000f6;kull that incorporate a variety of fine to coarse-grained lithofacies can be used not just for discrete instrument testing, but also for testing mission operations and payload deployment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work is funded by a Royal Society of Edinburgh Personal Research Fellowship, co-funded by the Marie Curie Actions FP7 Programme.

Introduction\\n\\nAs our search for Martian habitability progresses, so does our understanding of past environments and surface processes on Mars. From the “follow the water” approach employed by NASA during the Mars Exploration Rover and Phoenix missions, Mars exploration has since become focused on the identification of “habitability” and the detection of potential biosignatures [1,2]. One of the greatest shifts in our understanding of Mars surface geology has been the identification of widespread alteration minerals through orbital data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) and Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l’Eau, les Glaces et l’Activité (OMEGA) instruments [3,4,5], complimenting pre-existing morphological evidence for hydrological surface activity throughout the Noachian and into the Hesperian [6]. The global distribution of these deposits implies that aqueous processes and environments were active across much of the planet, resulting from a range of possible scenarios including climatic hydrological cycles, punctuated episodes of hydrological activity initiated by localised cryospheric melting, release of pressurized subsurface water aquifers, and isolated volcanic and impact events [6,7,8]. The nature of habitability on Mars is therefore underpinned by these processes at both spatial and temporal scales, and includes the availability of bioessential elements, metabolic redox couples, and stability and longevity of liquid water environments [9,10]. The expansive and diverse sedimentary record on Mars ranges from open and closed basin systems to rhythmite deposits putatively linked to climatic cycles, all of which have yet to be definitively explained but provide a record of potentially habitable palaeoenvironments [11]. Deltaic fan deposits for example, particularly those thought to have been deposited within a stable lacustrine setting, such as the Jezero crater open-basin lake system [12], suggest long-lived liquid water environments. Conversely, recent experimental work suggests many delta fans on Mars formed during short, intense episodes of high hydrological discharge [13]. Extensive networks of branching fluvial channels (predominantly Noachian terrains) and large outflow flood channels (predominantly late Hesperian terrains) also characterize the Martian surface [14]. Continued valley formation into the early Amazonian has been identified, with the youngest valleys thought to be related to hydrothermalism due to their confinement to volcanic constructs [15]. Similarly, alternating episodes of aqueous flooding and volcanism identified at Mangala Valles potentially indicate a causational relationship between the two, with evidence for repeated and interacting subsurface igneous and hydrological events occurring into the Late Amazonian [16]. Recently, [17] demonstrated the potential for short periods of global climatic warming instigated by episodic flood volcanism throughout the Noachian and Hesperian, which would result in temporary melting of surface ice and snow and the generation of fluvial and lacustrine systems.\\n\\nUnderstanding the cause and characteristics of these aqueous environments for astrobiology is challenging, but regardless of their interpretation, the deposits of such fluvial and lacustrine settings are currently a major target in continued robotic exploration of Mars, including the continued exploration of Gale Crater by Mars Science Laboratory and ongoing site-selection for the ESA ExoMars 2018 rover mission. Therefore, identifying which microbial metabolisms are supported by episodic, basalt-hosted fluvial-lacustrine systems can inform what biosignatures to search for, and how well rover instrumentation fares when deployed on such deposits. Likewise, understanding the preservation and detection of organic carbon and other “ingredients” of habitability within phyllosilicate- and sulfate-bearing sedimentary deposits that are mineralogically and geochemically analogous to those on Mars is imperative to continued successful exploration. Clay-bearing lithologies have been identified as particularly important targets for the detection of preserved organic matter [18]. On Earth, plate tectonics combined with continual surface and suboceanic weathering results in a complex and evolved clay cycle, whereby neoformed and inherited clays are deposited within a variety of active- and passive-margin sedimentary basins and subsequently buried, transformed through diagenetic and metamorphic processes, and recycled [19]. The lack of plate tectonics on Mars will most likely result in different pathways for clay formation and deposition [20], with the dominance of Fe/Mg clay deposits over Al-rich phyllosilicates consistent with the alteration of basaltic crust at low water/rock ratios [20]. This is consistent with basaltic crust being particularly susceptible to alteration and clay mineral formation due to the low-temperature instability of basaltic mineral phases, and the amorphous nature of any basaltic glass produced via eruptive products at the surface (i.e., lava flows, ash). Therefore, terrestrial environments typified by neoformed, authigenic clays (e.g., volcanogenic and hydrothermal clays, and clays directly precipitated from solution) and detrital inherited clays that have undergone little thermal transformation [19] are useful analogues to clays on Mars. Furthermore, where such clays on Earth form and are deposited in association with environments typified by relatively low biomass, there is scope to establish how biogenic organic matter may be preserved.\\n\\nSedimentary systems that exist within polar and high altitude environments are of use to Mars analogue research due to the minimal influence from vegetation, organic-rich surface soils, and anthropogenic activity. Alluvial fans in the Atacama Desert [21], debris flows in Alaska [22], and impact crater lake sedimentation [23] and saline springs [24] within the Canadian High Arctic have similarly been used or proposed as Mars analogues, and have provided important constraints as to the nature of comparable processes on Mars. However, a fundamental difference between the mineralogical products of alteration and weathering and the resulting sedimentary deposits is the relatively evolved, Si-Al rich nature of the Earth’s crust compared to the Fe-Mg rich crust of Mars [25] Initial results from the first four rocks examined by the NASA Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity revealed three of the four rocks to be volcaniclastic sediments of igneous origin, with a broadly basaltic composition [26], while sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay were also derived from sources compositionally consistent with basaltic crust [27], including detrital mafic minerals (e.g., Fe-forsterite, plagioclase, pigeonite, and augite) within the sediments [28]. This is unsurprising given the largely basaltic composition of the Martian crust [29], and likely to be a factor for other fluvial-lacustrine systems beyond those explored in Gale Crater. Indeed, some areas of extensive alteration on Mars have been interpreted as long-term aqueous interaction with basaltic crust [6] such as through low temperature, neutral pH hydrothermalism [30], high temperature acid fumarole alteration [31], or impact-generated hydrothermalism [32]. Therefore, when using terrestrial-based analogues for fluvial and lacustrine environments on Mars, it is imperative that future instrument testing and biosignature research includes similar basalt-derived sedimentary lithologies. For example, the utility of low-temperature alteration assemblages within the basaltic Deccan Traps, India, as an analogue for Al-phyllosilicate and Fe/Mg smectite stratigraphy on Mars has been previously demonstrated [33].\\n\\n\\n2. Iceland\\n\\nThe volcanic island of Iceland is unique in that its volcanotectonic setting lies at a juxtaposed mantle plume and rift system [34] within a near-arctic location. This volcanotectonic setting results in the crust having a broadly basaltic composition (Figure 1), with tholeiitic eruptive products reflecting these two main magmatic sources within the active rift zone [35,36]. Overall, the majority of Holocene basalts comprise three dominant magma series from tholeiitic, transitional alkalic, to alkalic [35,36], with Pleistocene basalts (predominantly subglacially-erupted pillow lavas and volcaniclastics, and interglacial lavas) exhibiting much the same trend [36,37]. This provides excellent examples of volcanogenic fluvial–lacustrine terrains, deposits, and environments where the primary crust and sediment parent material is basaltic in composition. The combination of Fe-Mg rich and Al-Si poor crust with aqueous environments that are locally influenced by elevated sulfur input due to their proximity to (or interaction with) volcanic activity make these sites valuable field models for detrital and authigenic mineral assemblages and the biosignatures deposited and potentially preserved.\\n\\nFigure 1 Total Alkali Silica plot adapted from [29] TES = Thermal Emission Spectrometer, GRS = Gamma Ray Spectrometer and including MSL Curiosity APXS data (Tables S1–S3, from [26]; Table 7 from [27]) and supplementary data (* marked) from [35]. All additional data added are 100%-normalised volatile free values.\\n\\nDue to the sub-arctic location of Iceland many parts of the country lie within glacial-periglacial-semi-arid climates, with annual precipitation as low as 400 mm in the interior [38]. As such, an estimated 60% of Icelandic glaciers overlie active volcanic systems [38]. This interaction between active volcanism along the neovolcanic zone and surface ice over the past 0.8 Ma [34] has resulted in widespread volcaniclastic sedimentation, including ubiquitous hyaloclastite/hyalotuff sequences, volcanogenic fluvial and lacustrine environments, and crustal hydrothermal alteration (both low and high temperature). Furthermore, many deposits and ongoing active environments are relatively undisturbed or reworked by vegetation, fauna, or human influence, particularly along the active rift zone (Figure 2B). Moreover, these regions are also specific analogues for putative glaciovolcanic landforms on Mars (e.g., [39]), which may represent one of the few habitable environments that could have pervaded into the Amazonian [39,40]. For more detail on the habitability of such glaciovolcanic habitats, the reader is referred to [41,42]. Iceland is a well-known locality for Mars analogue research, including aqueous alteration of basaltic crust [43] and gully formation [44]. Volcaniclastic sedimentary terrains and the fluvial-lacustrine processes that modify them have been largely overlooked, although comparisons have been made previously between subglacial outflow events (“jökulhlaups”) and flood channels on Mars [45], and a study by [46] demonstrated the utility of low temperature alteration phases within Icelandic basaltic outwash sediments as a good analogue for detecting similar assemblages on Mars. This paper provides a synthesis of example sedimentary fluvial-lacustrine terrains and contemporary active lacustrine environments in Iceland, with the view to present these as new and currently underused analogues for similar habitats and deposits on Mars, particularly with relevance to habitability and biosignature detection. As such, the aim of this paper is not to provide a direct geomorphological or formational analogue to specific terrains on Mars, but to expand the current variety of terrestrial localities which are of benefit to ongoing and future robotic exploration of Mars.\\n\\nFigure 2 (A) Map of Iceland showing the location of the sites covered in this paper.

These sites include examples of subglacial, englacial, and proglacial lacustrine environments and sedimentary deposits, and proglacial fluvial sedimentary deposits including jökulhlaup deposits, sedimentary fans, and sandur plains.

Lacustrine Environments\\n\\nLakes in glacial settings can form as a direct result of volcanic activity, where ice is converted to water by an increase in geothermal heat, forming englacial (glacier-bound), supraglacial (occurring at the glacier surface), and subglacial (occurring beneath the glacier) lakes. Because glacier margins themselves can also be sites of lacustrine activity (e.g., proglacial lakes), there is a complex interrelationship between volcanic episodes, lake evolution, and the resulting sedimentary products [47]. The volcanogenic glaciolacustrine environments detailed here result from the direct interaction between either a central volcano or hydrothermal vents and overlying ice [48]. They range from active subglacial lakes at Grímsvötn and Skaftá, and englacial hydrothermal lakes at Kverkfjöll, to glaciolacustrine sedimentary deposits north of Brúarjökull.\\n\\n\\n3.1. Subglacial Lakes\\n\\nVatnajökull ice cap overlies several active or dormant central volcanic systems within the neovolcanic zone [49]. Of these volcanic systems, Grímsvötn has been regularly active, producing recent eruptions in 1996 (Gjálp), 1998, 2004 and 2011. The eruption observed in 1996 at Gjálp was entirely subglacial, resulting in meltwater ponding beneath the ice cap [50]. This process is common at volcano-ice interaction sites, with ongoing heat flux often maintaining a subglacial meltwater lake in between eruptions [51]. Several investigations have been conducted into the biogeochemical environment and indigenous microbiology of the subglacial lakes at Grímsvötn and at the nearby Skaftá lakes beneath Vatnajökull. In 2004 [52] sampled the subglacial lake confined within the Grímsvötn crater ~300 m beneath the ice surface and identified a viable microbial community residing within the lake. Results showed the −0.2 °C, oxic, mildly acidic (pH 4.87–5.13) lake supported a community of psychrotolerant bacteria, distinct from bacterial communities within the surrounding ice and snow, that was well adapted to a glacial environment. In contrast, the nearby geothermal subglacial lake at Western Skaftá forms a warmer (3.5–6 °C) anerobic environment within its bottom waters, with a measureable input of hydrothermal fluids into the lake [53]. As such, the microbial communities indigenous to the subglacial anoxic bottom waters here are dominated by obligate or facultative anaerobes including members of Acetobacterium, Thermus, Paludibacter, Sulfuricurvum, Pseudomonas, and Sulfurospirillum species, forming a microbial ecosystem potentially driven by sulfide oxidation, sulfate reduction, and hydrogen oxidation [54] utilizing the available CO2 and sulfide within the lake environment (Figure 3). A similar geochemical environment (Figure 3) and microbial community was identified at the Eastern Skaftá subglacial lake, with anoxic water characterized by mean dissolved H2S of 16 ppm and CO2 of 105 ppm [55] and a microbial population dominated by Acetobacterium, Geobacter, Sulfurospirillum, Sulfuricurvum and Desulfosporosinus species.\\n\\nFurther investigation into a jökulhlaup outflow along the Skaftá river and a subaerial englacial lake (Kverkfjallalón—discussed in the next section) has shown that certain taxonomic groups here share a high level of genetic similarity with those in the subglacial Western Skaftá and Eastern Skaftá lakes, suggesting these systems are fed by a deeper crustal biosphere interconnected via groundwater circulating within the permeable basaltic crust beneath Vatnajökull, with differences in community composition controlled by local environmental conditions [55]. The chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacterium Sulfuricurvum in particular was found across all environments [55]. Such interconnected subsurface microbial habitats driven by episodic volcanogenic hydrothermal input, are analogous to habitable environments that feasibly may have existed on Mars [40], particularly at sites where direct volcano–ice interaction has been identified, such as Arsia Mons [39,40].\\n\\nFigure 3 Proportion of dissolved CO2 (77–1300 ppm), H2S (0.03–36.9 ppm), and SO42−(1.03–42.1 ppm) within East (A1–B4, data from [55]) and West (06-SKJ04, data from [53]) Skaftá subglacial lakes, and within the river Volga (Volga-C-1) and Hveragil (H-1 and H-4) outflows at Kverkfjöll (data from [55]. Upper plot shows total concentration for each respective site.\\n\\n\\n3.2. Englacial Lakes\\n\\nIce-bound englacial lakes sustained by hydrothermal activity provide a subaerial counterpart to the subglacial lakes detailed above, which are more readily accessible for sampling and research. Hydrothermal input into these lakes includes active hot springs and fumaroles within and around the shore of the lake [56]. At the Kverkfjöll volcano on the northern margin of Vatnajökull, the ~300 m diameter englacial hydrothermal lake Kverkfjallalón, locally also named Gengissig, is sustained by geothermal heating in between periodic drainage events, the most recent of which occurred in August 2013, producing a small jökulhlaup following a phreatic event [57]. Geothermal heating of this lake keeps it seasonally ice-free (Figure 4a), with summertime (June 2011) temperatures between 10–20 °C at the lake shore [41]. The microbiology from one sample taken at 4 m depth within this lake was found to be dominated almost entirely by the aerobic betaproteobacterium Xenophilus, a microorganism common to glacial environments [55]. However, for elucidating comparable metabolisms that could have operated within Martian lacustrine environments, where only anaerobic metabolisms are likely to have been feasible, englacial subaerial lakes such as Kverkfjallalón benefit from hydrothermal input, which results in localized anoxia or reduced dissolved oxygen (DO) at points of direct hydrothermal interaction or mixing, contrasting with the oxic areas of the lake. For example, DO at the lake edge measured in 2011 ranged from 0.8–3.9 mg/L [41]. Coupled with the availability of dissolved sulfate [41] (Figure 3), this provides a natural laboratory within which to investigate anaerobic chemolithotrophy within a lacustrine setting as a model for past Martian ecosystems. Indeed, glaciovolcanic landforms at Arsia Mons suggest that such an englacial lake was sustained through volcanic heating, potentially for hundreds to thousands of years [39]. Adjacent to Kverkfjallalón is a younger ice-dammed lake (locally termed “Galtarlón”). This clear blue lake (Figure 4c) has not yet been investigated with regards to its resident biota, but the clarity of the lake water suggests this environment will be highly nutrient limited, similar to supraglacial lakes observed on Greenlandic ice sheets [58]. These lakes represent low temperature hydrothermal lacustrine environments, with geochemical inputs driven by passive leaching of bioessential dissolved ions (e.g., Si, Ca, Na, Fe, Mg) from the underlying basaltic bedrock, mixing with hydrothermal fluids draining into the lake [41,53], and by active volcanic degassing of CO2, H2S, and H2 [56]. One major factor that may have differed between englacial lakes on Earth and lacustrine environments on Mars is the potential presence of sustained ice cover on Martian lakes, and the effect of this on sunlight and delivery of exogenous nutrients. However, given that phototrophy has not been identified as the primary means of production within the indigenous microbial communities present within Kverkfjallalón [55], and that both Kverkfjallalón and nearby Galtarlón typically lose their ice-cover predominantly during summer months (and some years not at all, Figure 4c,d), which has the benefit of improving accessibility for sampling, this difference does not detract from the value of these sites as a suitable microbial analogue.\\n\\nSediments sampled from Kverkfjallalón and nearby lake shore areas in June 2011 were found to comprise of detrital plagioclase and pyroxene sourced from the underlying basalt, and alteration phases including smectite clays, gypsum, jarosite, pyrite, heulandite, and quartz [41]. This combination of unaltered basaltic minerals and low temperature alteration phases is analogous to sediments (although not the depositional environment) explored by the MSL Curiosity rover at Yellowknife Bay, which included detrital basaltic minerals, smectites, calcium sulfates, iron oxide or hydroxides, iron sulfides, and amorphous material [28]. Englacial lake sediments can be emplaced in the sedimentary record via repeated jokulhlaup events, such as the jokulhlaup sandur deposits identified in the proglacial region of Kverkfjöll [59] and described in Section 4 below. Over long time scales, englacial hydrothermal lake sediments deposited either via jökulhlaups or through deposition by a receding glacier would be identifiable by the presence of mineral assemblages that include pyrite and other sulfur-bearing alteration minerals, including jarosite and gypsum [41]. Such sediments therefore provide a test environment for tracing the local environmental history and available metabolic redox couples.\\n\\nFigure 4 Examples of lacustrine environments and deposits.

Proglacial Lacustrine Environments\\n\\nUnlike subglacial and englacial lakes, proglacial lakes can be the focus of significant sediment deposition, but may lack the hydrothermal input required to sustain a variety of chemolithotrophic metabolisms. A recent example of lacustrine fan deposition occurred at the 20–30 m deep proglacial lake Gígjökulslón following the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull [61]. Here, a volcanogenic jökulhlaup sequence was dominated by two large outburst floods totalling 57 × 106 m3 of water [60]. Meltwater stored within the glacier drained sub- and supra-glacially into Gígjökulslón, producing two prograding ice-contact sediment fans (Figure 4b,e). Further outbursts of meltwater occurred, completely infilling Gígjökulslón, followed by >140 smaller outburst floods, attributed to continued subglacial melt at the eruption site and beneath Gígjökull glacier [60]. Together, these events resulted in a depositional fan of varying steepness emanating from a bedrock gorge (Figure 4e). The jökulhlaups were sediment rich, draining much of the subglacially-erupted volcanic material [61] with the majority of deposition estimated to occur over a short time frame of ~48 h [60]. Such deposits provide an example of primary, organically-poor basaltic sediment fans that have undergone little aqueous alteration or transport.\\n\\nThe emplacement of volcanic edifices and subsequent localised increase in elevation can also lead to the natural damming of glacial meltwater and subsequent formation of a proglacial lake during glacial retreat. An example of this can be seen in the Pleistocene sedimentary record within the proglacial region of Brúarjökull. Here, a palaeolake damned by the subglacially erupted pillow basalt and volcaniclastic edifice of Kárahnúkar became progressively in-filled with lacustrine and deltaic sediments during deglaciation in the Quaternary [62]. These proglacial lacustrine sediments at originated from subaqueous fan and low-angle delta environments, and are now partly exposed along the Jökulsá á Brú from the current margin of Brúarjökull. Following deposition of these lacustrine sequences, fluvial channels have since cut into these sediments, thought to result from the lake dam being breached [62]. Lacustrine and glaciofluvial sedimentary sequences formed during glacial retreat also exist along the nearby Fljótsdalur and Jökuldalur valleys in East Iceland [63], which channelled ice flow over successive glaciations [64]. This process of sedimentation forms a temporal contrast to the rapid sediment formation and deposition observed during jökulhlaup release into a lake, as observed at Gígjökulslón. These sites therefore contain a sedimentary record depicting a range of depositional lacustrine environments. There is an absence of a clay component here, even within the fine-grained sediment units [63]. While this limits this site for analogue work focusing on those lacustrine environments on Mars that exhibit phyllosilicate spectral signatures, it is more applicable to the majority of paleolake systems on Mars that do not show this evidence for alteration minerals [65].\\n\\n\\n4. Fluvial Environments\\n\\nVolcanogenic fluvial processes are common in Iceland, where volcano-ice and geothermal-ice interaction can result in the sudden drainage of large volumes of stored glacial meltwater (jökulhlaups) and continual low-discharge meltwater release in between jökulhlaup events [51]. Moreover, geothermal and meltwater dissolution of glass-rich basaltic tephra releases elements into these meltwaters, enabling the delivery of biologically-limiting elements (e.g., phosphorous and iron) into the surrounding proglacial environment [66]. For example, the 1996 jökulhlaup originating from the subglacial eruption at Gjálp had an estimated dissolved volatile and element load of 1 million tonnes [67,68], with suspended sediments comprising fresh glass, palagonite (amorphous primary product of basaltic glass alteration), alteration minerals (such as zeolite and calcite), plagioclase, augite, and olivine, and rock fragments [67]. This meltwater generated by the Gjálp eruption had a pH ranging between 3 and 8 at the eruption site, with the resulting flood water pH ranging from 6.88 to 7.95 [68]. Jökulhlaups from Mýrdalsjökull and Vatnajökull in 2011 were also found to have alkaline-neutral pH waters [66], with increased levels of dissolved organic carbon, formate, and acetate observed within the Mýrdalsjökull jökulhlaup, which suggests microbiological activity was present within the subglacial meltwater stored beneath Mýrdalsjökull prior to its catastrophic release [66]. This is consistent with the observation of viable microbial communities within subglacial lakes at Grímsvötn and Skaftá cauldrons beneath Vatnajökull [52,54,55], and highlights the potential for subglacial meltwater release as a mechanism of transport and deposition of biogenic organic matter within volcanogenic fluvial and lacustrine fan sediments. A contemporary example of this process is provided by the multiple jökulhlaups (at least 40 since 1955 [48]) that have occurred along the Skaftá river, draining the Western and Eastern Skaftá subglacial lakes [48], some of which are known to be inhabited by chemolithotrophic bacterial communities [54,55]. A study by [69] showed high levels (nearly 9 g·L−1) of suspended fine-grained sediment (up to ~60% sediment 0.002–0.02 mm in particle size) was transported during a jökulhlaup here in 1997, together with increased concentrations of chloride and fluoride, consistent with geothermal input into the meltwaters [69]. Such repeated deposition of subglacially-sourced sediment provides a contemporary analogue to the transport and burial of subglacially-sourced organics derived from the geothermally-driven microbial communities present with the subglacial caldera lakes. While the vast majority of fluvial sediments on Mars are not jökulhlaup deposits, the utility of these Icelandic sites for Mars analogue research lies in their connectivity to lacustrine environments typified by chemolithotrophic and/or oligotrophic microbial communities, mafic mineralogy and related alteration phases, and subsequent deposition within cold and dry basaltic terrains.\\n\\nFurther to the south of Vatnajökull, the Skeiðarársandur proglacial sediments form the largest active outwash plain in the world [38], and as such record an extensive history of fluvial-lacustrine sedimentary deposition throughout the Holocene. An assemblage of fluvial and lacustrine sediments [70] is revealed along the Gígjukvísl River (Figure 5a), cut by the jökulhlaup in 1996. The section exposed here is ~240 m long with a maximum height of over 20 m (Figure 5d), and contains seven lithofacies, of which three are identified as fluvial, and four as lacustrine, forming a succession of depositional environments including a shallow ice-marginal braided river, proglacial braided river gravel bed, glaciolacustrine deposits, a high energy subaqueous flow, and finally a jökulhlaup event [70]. This outcrop therefore provides a variety of continuous sedimentary lithofacies for investigating biosignature deposition across a range of environments, and testing of future robotic instrumentation (Table 1). Sedimentary structures within the different fluvial lithofacies range from horizontally stratified or channelized sand layers within the ice marginal shallow braided stream, to well-sorted and cross-bedded gravels in the braided river gravel bed. Glaciolacustrine lithofacies encompass interbedded silts and fine sand and rippled silt layers. Finally, the jökulhlaup deposit encompasses the coarsest sediments with cross-cutting scours cutting into poorly sorted gravels, with well-developed imbrication [70]. Sediments exposed along the Gígjukvísl river have already been used for Mars analogue work investigating the utility of hand-lens imager type datasets (e.g., similar to data produced by the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) on NASA’s MSL Curiosity rover) in characterizing sedimentary grain size and morphology, from which fluvial palaeoflows and processes can be interpreted [71]. Fluvial conglomerates comprising of cemented rounded pebbles have since been identified on Mars by the MSL Curiosity rover, providing the first in situ evidence of fluvial sedimentary deposition, most likely as part of a distal alluvial fan deposit [72].\\n\\nSuccessions of fluvial sedimentation can also be found at Sólheimajökull (a small outlet glacier of the larger Mýrdalsjökull ice cap) and Kverkjökull (a small outlet glacier near Kverkfjöll, on the northern margin of Vatnajökull). At Sólheimajökull (Figure 5b), a jökulhlaup occurred in 1999 following volcanic activity at Katla subglacial volcano, and included meltwater transport both supraglacially, and along the glacier bed, and temporary meltwater storage within ice-marginal basins [73]. Jökulhlaup sedimentation within the glacier produced esker ridges and a large fan at the glacier snout [73] and deposits of fine (clay–silt or finer) sediment on the glacier surface. Glacial retreat since the event has exposed an esker bearing two depositional units: well-sorted cross-stratified gravels and a poorly sorted boulder unit [73]. Glaciofluvial eskers have been proposed to explain many of the sinuous ridges on Mars [74], potentially in association with glaciaolacustrine deposits [74]. At Kverkjökull (Figure 5c), there are a number of active fluvial environments and associated sedimentary and mineralogical deposits. Within the proglacial region of Kverkjökull, 3 km of sedimentary sections within a fluvially-incised sedimentary fan records at least six volcanogenic jökulhlaup events [59]. This sandur comprises several distinctive lithofacies, including (in order of decreasing grainsize) poorly sorted clast- and matrix-supported boulder-gravel facies, a clast-supported gravel unit that dominates the sedimentary section, a pebble-granule-gravel facies with well-defined bedding planes, and finally a sand facies comprising thin (<1 cm) sand layers which form boundary layers between gravel beds [59]. As with the sedimentary sections at Gígjukvísl, these deposits provide an ideal site for testing robotic instrumentation and biosignature preservation on basaltic sediments within a largely vegetation-free terrain (Figure 5c). The Kverkjökull proglacial environment also includes the river Volga, a meltwater stream of subglacial origin with variable hydrothermal input from the Kverkfjoll high temperature geothermal areas [56]. This CO2-sulfate fluvial environment contrasts to the CO2-sulfide dominated subglacial lacustrine environments under Vatnajökull (Figure 3). Similarly, to the east of Kverkfjöll lies the geothermal river Hveragil, a CO2-rich carbonate-depositing neutral-alkaline stream [41,56].\\n\\nFigure 5 Examples of proglacial fluvial environments and sedimentary deposits.

Conclusions\\n\\nThe environments and depositional settings detailed within this paper can both sustain and potentially preserve evidence of Mars-analogue psychrophilic or chemolithotrophic microbial communities. These basaltic sedimentary lithologies produced through fluvial and lacustrine action, much of which is volcanogenic itself, can serve as a broad analogue for fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary terrains on Mars, particularly where discrete sedimentary deposits containing alteration phases lie within predominantly basaltic terrain. In addition, these sites also act as specific glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial systems.\\n\\nWith relevance to the preservation and detection of organic material within fluvial-lacustrine sediments, the glaciovolcanic lacustrine systems outlined here can serve as a model as to how well organic matter can be preserved within environments with low biological productivity, and, at least for the active systems, where primary production is predominantly driven by chemolithoautotrophy rather than phototrophy. In addition, given the necessity to confidently distinguish between authigenic and detrital clay (and other alteration) minerals via in situ exploration [20], such sites can be used to test the interpretation of data products acquired from future prototypes and breadboard instruments, where both authigenic (e.g., glaciovolcanic hydrothermal lakes) and detrital alteration minerals (e.g., fluvial sediments) can be investigated within a connected system (i.e., tracing mineral formation and transport from source to sink). A summary of site-specific analogue science is summarized in Table 1. For example, the sedimentary stratigraphic exposures at Gígjökulslón, Brúarjökull proglacial region, and Kverkjökull lend themselves well to field-testing imaging instrumentation in particular, where the scientific objectives are to incorporate geological context and palaeoenvironmental interpretation of lithologies from wide-angle, high resolution, 2D and 3D image data. This is especially true when geomorphological features are important in assessing past habitability, such as grain size, roundness, and sorting (e.g., [72]). Likewise, the assessment of palaeohabitability from rover- or lander-based remote sensing datasets such as those produced by Pancam/Mastcam, MAHLI, and ChemCam instruments [75] can be fine-tuned at such sites where specific stratigraphic horizons may need to be targeted (e.g., when searching for biosignatures) within sedimentary exposures comprising different lithofacies. For example fluvial sediments deposited along the Skaftá river during the periodic catastrophic draining of the Skaftá subglacial lakes would be an ideal target to test for the preservation of organic carbon fixed by the chemolithotrophic communities residing within the subglacial lakes of Vatnajökull, while glaciolacustrine and fluvial stratigraphy within the Brúarjökull proglacial region and the Fljótsdalur and Jökuldalur valleys can be used for testing spectroscopic instrumentation and the detection of discrete mineralogical horizons. To this end, given the range of grainsize, sedimentary fabrics, and mineralogy present within different fluvial and lacustrine lithofacies sourced predominantly from basaltic protoliths, the preservation of organics as a function of depositional time (i.e., rapid, slow), grainsize (i.e., fine or coarse), and mineralogy (i.e., detrital basalt or alteration phases) warrants investigation. The same applies to inorganic biosignatures, such as stable isotope fractionation values of sulfur produced through microbial sulfur reduction and preserved by sedimentary pyrite grains within lacustrine sediments [41].\\n\\nFinally, the range of coarse to fine-grained lithologies at all these sites make these them suitable for testing sampling and sample manipulation instrumentation (such as corers, scoops, drills, grinders, sieves and crushers), particularly where instruments have to cope with a local mixture of different grainsize and matrix components. In this sense, large-scale sites at Gígjökulslón and the proglacial regions of Brúarjökull and Kverkjökull that incorporate a variety of fine to coarse-grained lithofacies can be used not just for discrete instrument testing, but also for testing mission operations and payload deployment.', 'text_matches': ['field site'], 'article_meta': {'has_body': True, 'article_type': 'review-article'}, 'article_title': 'Volcanogenic Fluvial-Lacustrine Environments in Iceland and Their Utility for Identifying Past Habitability on Mars', 'journal_title': 'Life'}\n"

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "A growing body of research on the communicative behaviour of non-human primates has demonstrated that their vocalisations can convey a considerably rich amount of information that is meaningful to receivers (e.g. [1]). For instance, field experiments with various primate species have shown that acoustically distinct alarm calls can inform listeners about specific types of dangers (e.g. [2]–[5]). In some species, there is evidence that signallers produce strings of acoustically variable calls composed in context-specific ways (e.g. [6]–[8]). For example, black-and-white Colobus monkeys (Colobus polykomos, C. guereza) produce two types of vocalisations to predators, which are arranged in event-specific sequences that are seemingly meaningful to others [8].\n",
      "\n",
      "Food discovery is another event type during which some primates produce highly context-specific vocalisations. Since food is often patchily distributed and seasonally dispersed, food calls can provide listeners with a useful means to access foraging patches more effectively, while callers appear to gain mainly social benefits [9]–[10]. The production of food-associated calls is not restricted to primates but found in other mammals and some birds, e.g. Gallus gallus[11], although relatively little is still known about the type of information conveyed by the calls. At the simplest level, food calls are a basic physiological response indicating that the caller has found something desirable, as demonstrated by receivers approaching food calls more rapidly than other calls [12]–[13] or by triggering foraging behaviour [14]. In some species, food calls appear to provide more detailed information about the food item itself, such as its quality or divisibility, which can be encoded by changes in call rates [12], [15]–[17] or acoustic structure [18]–[19]. For example, Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) produce up to five different food-associated call types [20], which receivers discriminate based on differences in their referential features, rather than their acoustic properties alone [21].\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the great apes, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) produce specific calls when discovering food, the ‘rough grunts’ [22]–[23]. The morphology of this call type co-varies with the caller's personal food preference both in captivity and the wild [24]. In a naturalistic playback experiment, it was demonstrated that acoustic variation in this call influences the foraging decisions of receivers, suggesting that the acoustic structure of this graded signal provides meaningful information to other chimpanzees about the quality of food encountered by the caller [25].\n",
      "\n",
      "What exactly governs receiver responses, however, is a matter of ongoing debate. For instance it is not clear whether receivers respond directly to the calls' physical features or their referential nature, i.e. the causal relation between calls and contexts [26]–[27]. Similarly, signalling is often said to be non-cooperative with signallers merely producing ‘natural’ information in response to biologically relevant events, while any representational content is largely generated by the listeners [28]. These problems are unsolved because the psychological states experienced by primates during call production and perception are rarely investigated. In one recent study, however, food call production in wild chimpanzees was found to co-vary with the presence and arrival of long-term allies, suggesting these calls may be used as a flexible social strategy [10].\n",
      "\n",
      "Very little is known about how our other closest relative, the bonobo (Pan paniscus), naturally communicates about events in the external world. This is despite the fact that some individuals have been remarkably capable in mastering artificial language systems [29]–[30]. In one recent systematic study, Clay & Zuberbühler [31] demonstrated that bonobos also vocalize upon encountering food, but that there are important differences between the two Pan species. Whilst both species produce food ‘grunts’, bonobos additionally give four acoustically distinguishable tonal calls when finding food (barks, peeps, peep-yelps, and yelps), which although lying on a graded scale, can be statistically discriminated from one another [31]. Barks are longest in duration, characterised by a distinctive pointed shape and numerous visible harmonic bands. Whilst peeps are also high pitched, they are temporally shorter than barks (and all other calls), with few harmonic bands and had a flat frequency contour. Yelps and peep-yelps are lower in pitch and although share acoustically similarities, yelps possess a marked downward stroke frequency contour, in contrast to the arched contour of the peep-yelps. In terms of production, peeps and barks are most frequently, but not exclusively, given to preferred foods, while yelps and grunts are more often, but not exclusively, given to less preferred foods. Peep-yelps are produced broadly, although they also tend to occur more to mid- and lesser-preferred foods. In sum, the link between individual call types and perceived food quality is only probabilistic in bonobos. One important consequence of this is that different food calls themselves do not appear to allow listeners to make strong predictions about the type of food encountered by the caller. However, in contrast to chimpanzees, bonobos regularly combine different call types together into longer mixed sequences. The composition of these food call sequences related reliably to food quality, suggesting that listeners can gain information from attending to the call sequences. The hypothesis of meaningful call combinations has been put forward before for bonobos, but has never been tested formally [32]–[33].\n",
      "\n",
      "In the current study, we examined whether listeners were able to extract meaningful information relating to food quality by attending to the composition of these heterogeneous call sequences. To this end, we conducted naturalistic playback experiments in which subjects heard different types of food all sequences, and their subsequent foraging responses were analysed.\n",

      "The study was conducted at Twycross Zoo, UK, between April and July 2009. Individuals were permanently separated into two subgroups that occupied different indoor facilities but shared the same outdoor area via two separate doors in the morning or afternoon, respectively (fig. 1; table 1). We conducted playback experiments in which we broadcast food-calls of an individual of the morning subgroup responding to either high-quality food (kiwi) or low-quality food (apple) to all members of the afternoon subgroup before releasing them into the outdoor enclosure. Our general aim was to simulate a morning group individual discovering food of high or low quality in the outdoor area shortly before the release of the afternoon subgroup. We also included a control condition in which no food calls were played. We then assessed the foraging behaviours of receivers at previously learned locations for high-quality and low-quality food in the outdoor enclosure (fig. 1).\n",

      "\n",
      "Following release, there was a strong baseline preference for the highly preferred ‘kiwi’ field. This was particularly evident in the control condition (when no food was presented), in which individuals were more likely to visit the kiwi field first and more often, as well as devoting more foraging effort to it compared to the apple field (fig. 2). Despite this baseline bias, playbacks of food-associated calls had an overall significant effect on the individuals' first choice of fields (χ2 (2) = 16.347, p<.001; Pearson chi-square, two-tailed; fig. 2a). Playback of call sequences originally given to kiwi resulted in an increase in first visits to the kiwi field, compared to baseline or apple trials. However, this change failed to reach significance due to a ceiling effect caused by the strong baseline bias for kiwi (First arrivals to kiwi site per individual: median N trials: control condition = 3.0 (50% of trials); kiwi playback condition = 6.0 (86%); apple playback condition = 5.0 (50%), all one-way χ2 tests: p>.05). Playback of call sequences originally give to apple resulted in a significant increase in the number of first visits to the apple field, compared to baseline or kiwi trials (First arrivals to apple site, per individual: median N trials: control condition = 0.0; kiwi playback condition = 0.0; apple playback condition = 4.0 (40%); both control and kiwi vs. apple: χ2 (1, N = 17) = 13.235, p<.001, with Bonferroni corrected alpha .0169). Hearing food-associated call sequences, in other words, influenced the bonobos' foraging decisions against their pre-existing food preference biases. We conducted this first analysis at the group level because individuals almost always foraged as a cohesive unit and, when released, entered the outside enclosure almost simultaneously (table S1).\n",

      "10.1371/journal.pone.0018786.g002Figure 2 Box plots indicating foraging responses of bonobos (N = 4) following playbacks of food-associated calls given to high value (kiwi) or low value (apple) foods.(a) Site of first entry expressed as a median proportion of the individual's median choices per condition; (b) median number of visits per trial; (c) median time spent foraging following playback (s). Box plots illustrate medians, inter-quartile ranges, and highest and lowest values, excluding outliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we determined whether hearing playbacks influenced the number of visits the group made to the two fields (fig. 2b). Again, we found a significant effect of playback condition on the median number of visits made by the group to both the kiwi field (χ2 = 6.486, df = 2, p = .034; two-tailed exact Kruskal-Wallis test) and the apple field (χ2 = 10.532, df = 2, p = .002; two-tailed exact Kruskal-Wallis test). Post-hoc, pair-wise comparisons using a Bonferroni correction (corrected alpha = .0169) revealed that individuals visited the ‘kiwi’ field more often after hearing ‘kiwi’ call sequences compared to control trials (mediancontrol = 0.5; mediankiwi = 1.0; medianapple = 1.0; N visits to kiwi field, ‘kiwi’ playback vs. control: Mann-Whitney U = 4.5, p = .015). Conversely, we found that individuals visited the apple field more often after hearing playback of ‘apple’ call sequences compared to the control condition (mediancontrol = 0.0; mediankiwi = 0.5; medianapple = 1.0; N visits to apple field, ‘apple’ playback vs control: U = 3, p = .002).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, hearing playbacks of food-associated call sequences had a significant effect on the foraging time devoted by the group at both the kiwi site (χ2 = 6.902, df = 2, p = .026; two-tailed exact Kruskal-Wallis test) and the apple site (χ2 = 10.876, df = 2, p = .002; two-tailed exact Kruskal-Wallis test; fig. 2c). Pair-wise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected alpha = .0169) revealed that individuals spent more time at the kiwi location after hearing ‘kiwi’ call sequences compared to control condition (mediancontrol = 2.25s; mediankiwi = 16.50s; medianapple = 5.75s; Kiwi site, ‘kiwi’ playback vs. control: Mann-Whitney U = 5, p = .022,) or hearing ‘apple’ call sequences (‘kiwi’ playback vs. ‘apple’ playback: U = 15.5, p = .058). Likewise, individuals spent more time in the apple field after hearing playbacks of ‘apple’ call sequences compared to control trials (mediancontrol = 0.0s; median apple = 9.5s; mediankiwi = 1.5; apple field, ‘apple’ playback vs. control: Mann-Whitney U = 6, p = .015). Although there was a trend for spending more time foraging at apple after hearing apple playbacks compared to kiwi playbacks, the result did not reach significance (apple vs. kiwi playbacks: U = 20, p>.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "All previous analyses were based on non-parametric comparisons at the group level. We selected this analysis strategy to avoid problems with data interdependency and type-two clustering errors [34] at the cost of a substantial reduction in statistical power. Thus, in a second set of analyses we relied on Generalized Linear Mixed Models based on Poisson distributions and log link functions (GLMM), which allowed us to maximise the amount of data available by considering the contributions of individuals. We accounted for individual identity by entering it as a random factor, although it may be argued that combining individuals into one model will not completely eliminate the problem of interdependency, The GLMM procedure is an extension of the more widely known General Linear Model (GLM) and is particularly useful for this study because it relaxes assumptions of normal data distribution and an identity link [35].\n",
      "\n",
      "This GLMM analysis revealed the same main effects, with a significant interaction between playback type and the number of visits to the two fields (two-tailed GLMM, F (2,178) = 5.037, p = .007; fig. 2b; table S2). Pair-wise comparisons revealed that individuals visited the kiwi field significantly more often after hearing ‘kiwi’ call sequences compared to control trials (p = 0.028). They also visited the apple field significantly more often after hearing ‘apple’ call sequences compared to control and kiwi conditions (p<.001; p = 0.008, respectively).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, hearing playbacks of food-associated call sequences had a significant effect on the foraging time devoted by each of the four individuals in the two fields (two-tailed GLMM: F (2, 178) = 120.772, p<.001; fig. 2c, table S3). Pair-wise comparisons revealed that individuals spent more time at the kiwi location after hearing ‘kiwi’ call sequences than ‘apple’ call sequences or compared to control trials (both p<.001). Likewise, individuals spent more time in the apple field after hearing playbacks of ‘apple’ call sequences compared to ‘kiwi’ call sequences or compared to control trials (both p<.001).\n",

      "A key indicator of representationally-based signal processing is that subjects sometimes make mistakes, particularly with signals that are ambiguous or only weakly correlated with specific external events [28]. In our sample, some call sequences were better indicators of high or low food quality than others in terms of call composition, suggesting that if subjects made mistakes then this should happen in response to the more ambiguous sequences (e.g. visiting the apple field after hearing a kiwi sequence). To address this, we assigned a cumulative value to each sequence, based on its call composition. Each call contributed with a value that reflected its association strength with high preference food (table 2). For instance, in natural calling sequences, ‘barks’ were given six times more frequently to high than low preference food (proportion of ‘barks’ in calling sequences to high preference foods = 0.24, vs. low-preference foods = 0.04). Similarly, peeps were given 1.86 times more frequently to high than low preference food (proportion of ‘peeps’ in calling sequences to high preference foods = 0.52 vs. low-preference food = 0.28), and so on. These relative differences resulted in the following cumulative values: B = 6.00, P = 1.86, PY = 0.52, Y = 0.12. We also assigned an ordinal scale, based on the strength of their relationship to high-preference foods, with ‘barks’ being given most frequently to high-preference foods and yelps most infrequently: B = 4, P = 3, PY = 2, Y = 1 (see fig. 3, table 3).\n",

      "There was a significant positive correlation between subjects’ foraging effort in the kiwi field and the overall cumulative food value as assessed by the composition of the sequence (time spent: cardinal scale Spearman's rho: N = 17 rs = 0.585, p = .014, fig. 3; ordinal scale: N = 17, rs = 0.575, p = .016). Inspection at the level of individual trials indicated an almost perfect separation of sequences given to apples and kiwis by the cumulative sequence value generated by the constituent calls. One exception was a call sequence given to apples (PY-B-B-PY), which interestingly also triggered almost twice as much searching in the (wrong) kiwi compared to the apple field. Also interesting were two responses to kiwi sequences, which only triggered weak searching in the kiwi field. However, in both cases, search effort in the apple field was also unusually low, suggesting that subjects were generally unmotivated to forage (table 3). In sum, the foraging effort was a strong reflection of the cumulative ‘good food’ score encoded by the sequence.\n",

      "Human-enculturated bonobos have long been known for their extraordinary representational and communication skills [29]–[30], [36]–[37], but their natural communication behaviour has hardly been investigated. Our study provides progress to this end in showing that bonobos can increase their foraging success by attending to each other's call sequences. Our key finding was that subjects were able to direct their foraging effort to specific locations according to the call sequence presented to them. Whilst we found an unsurprising baseline preference to the high-preference food site, we found that playbacks of high-preference food call sequences resulted in an even greater amount of foraging effort at this site, indicating the calls were meaningful to the receivers. Furthermore, although lack of interest at the low-food preference apple site was to be expected (see baseline trials) we found a significant increase in search effort at this site that only occurred after hearing sequences associated with low-preference food. This result further suggests that individuals incorporated information extracted from the food call sequences to optimise their foraging strategies, in some cases against pre-existing foraging biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it would be interesting to investigate the mechanism of decision making within the group, we were not able to address this point in our study due to the constraints of working with subjects that were part of a public display (with Zoo regulations prohibiting separation). It is likely that there were individual differences in the ability to assign meaning to the different call sequences used as playback stimuli, either due to individual differences in knowledge or other more immediate factors, such as receiver attention or motivation during the trials. Despite these constraints, we are able to draw the conservative conclusion that at least one individual in our group was able to comprehend the information conveyed by the call sequences, though the results of some trials suggested that several or all group members made their own independent foraging decisions prior to being released into the enclosure. For example, we found that, across trials, different individuals arrived at the food sites first and, in some trials, individuals diverged in their first choices (table S1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Our results also show that, although chimpanzees and bonobos are phylogenetically closely related, they appear to communicate about food in considerably different ways. In contrast to chimpanzees, who produce an acoustically graded call type that co-varies with food quality [26], bonobos regularly mix several acoustically distinct food call types into heterogeneous strings of vocalisations. Rather than at the level of individual calls, food quality appears related to the probabilistic composition of heterogeneous call sequences [31]. Results from our playback experiment indicate that rather than attending to individual call types, receivers took into account the relative proportions of different calls within the sequence and extracted meaning by integrating information from across the call units.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the generation of more foraging errors in structurally ambiguous call sequences (which were less strongly indicative of high or low preference foods) indicated that the information extracted from the stimuli sequences was influencing the foraging decisions of the receivers. In a recent discussion, Stegmann [28] argued that in contrast to ‘natural information’, which does not allow for errors, the generation of misrepresentations and errors is a defining feature of what we consider as ‘semantic information’ in animal signals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst there is a growing body of evidence that numerous monkey species produce strings or sequences of acoustically variable calls composed in context-specific ways, evidence for meaningful signal combinations in apes has been poor (although see [38]). A recent study of gorilla gestural sequences failed to find evidence of syntactic organisation or corresponding semantic content [39]. Results from the current study provide the first empirical evidence that call combinations do play a role in bonobo communication in the foraging context. However, it is important to note that we also did not find any evidence for syntactic rules or that the sequencing structure itself was itself semantically relevant. Thus, although call combinations appear to represent a useful means of communicating information in bonobos, the manner in which bonobos use call combinations contrasts the way linguistic units are combined and structured in human language. This finding highlights the importance of studying non-human primate communication as a means to identify the features of the language faculty that are uniquely human.\n",
      "\n",
      "One recurrent topic in the animal communication literature is whether signals given in response to external events, such as in this study, should be conceptualised as ‘referential’ or a mere readout of a caller's motivational or internal state [26], [40]–[41]. Great apes, especially chimpanzees and bonobos, are often described as exceedingly ‘emotional’, suggesting that arousal-based explanations may be more in line with the nature of the phenomenon described here (e.g. [26]). In particular, sequences containing a greater amount of calls with presumably high emotional valence may lead receivers to search at the high-value food site. Although we do not discount the integral role motivation plays in animal communication [26], [41], gaining meaningful measurements of internal state or arousal have so far proved very challenging, and thus it has often proved more empirically fruitful to focus on the relation between receiver response and external variables that can be manipulated and measured experimentally [1], [42]. Furthermore, even calls with presumably high motivational content (as may be the case for food discovery) are still able to inform receivers about the external world. This has been demonstrated by studies showing that, regardless of the signaller's motivational state during call production, calls can provide listeners with representational information about external objects and events, in way that can be studied experimentally [1], [27], [41], [43]–[45]. Recent work on the alarm call responses of meerkats (Suricata suricata) for example, has demonstrated that both emotional and referential information are encoded into the same signal and develop on different ontogenetic time scales [45]. Meaningful progress will focus more specifically on the motivational experience of the caller and how this influences signal production.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do receivers extract information from these call sequences? Are they attending to individual calls or do they perceive the sequence as a holistic unit? For example, it could be argued that an increasing number of high-pitched calls, such as peeps and barks, increases the perceived gestalt of the sequence in a discrete way, enabling individuals to make foraging decisions without paying attention to individual calls. Further research will be necessary to address this issue in more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another related question is whether receivers process vocalisations purely based on their acoustic properties, or whether they attach some semantic value to them. For example, subjects may have learned the contingencies of this particular experiment, e.g. that high-pitched vocalisations were associated with food at one specific location, without any understanding of more general relations between a caller's perceived food quality and the vocal signals produced in response. However, research on food-associated calls of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), another primate with a graded vocal system, has demonstrated that individuals categorise calls based on their meaning, not just their acoustic structure alone [31]. Whether bonobos process their own calls in the same way remains open as a topic for future research.\n",
      "\n",
      "A final unresolved question concerns the function of food call production in bonobos. In capuchins (Cebus capucinus), food calls are thought to provide ecological benefits, functioning to announce food ownership and a willingness to defend, thereby resulting in reducing foraging competition from others [46]. In red-bellied tamarins (Saguinas labiatus), it has been suggested that food calls are not solely a function of arousal in the presence of highly desirable food patches, but may provide social benefits by attracting allies, even at the cost of increasing feeding competition [9]. A similar effect has recently been indicated in wild male chimpanzees who were found to call more in the presence of close allies and even recommenced calling upon their arrival [10]. For bonobos, it has also been suggested that individuals receive benefits from producing food calls, for instance by attracting mates or potential allies [47]. Further work investigating the interplay and influence of social and ecological variables on the production of food-associated calls in bonobos is required to explore the adaptive significance of these calls in this species.\n",

      "The study was conducted at Twycross Zoo, UK, between April and July 2009.Individuals were permanently separated into two subgroups that occupied separate indoor facilities but shared the same outdoor area via two separate doors (fig. 1). Subgroup A consisted of 5 individuals (2 adult males and females, 1 juvenile female; range 6–29 years); subgroup B consisted of 6 individuals (1 adult male, 3 adult females, 1 juvenile male, 1 juvenile female; range 4–32 years; table 1). Each subgroup was housed in one of two separated heated indoor halls (62 m2) with additional sleeping areas (22 m2) and both facilities were separately connected to an outdoor enclosure (588 m2). There was no visual contact between indoor and outdoor enclosures, although vocalizations produced outside could be heard indoors. Both subgroups were fed a range of fruits and vegetables twice per day in a scatter feed. Water was freely available. Bonobos were provided with regular enrichment materials and feeds (such as branches, seeds, grapes or frozen juice) as well as supplements such as yoghurt, egg and bread.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Twycross Zoo Ethics and Management Committee and the Zoo Research Coordinator and gave full ethical approval to this behavioural, non-invasive study, which complied with the ethical guidelines set out by the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA). During all stages of the study, we took steps to ensure that the welfare of all animals was not compromised. No individual showed distress during any part of this study and their participation throughout was voluntary. In order to reduce stress and to comply with Zoo guidelines, we did not separate any individual in any stage of this study.\n",

      "Experimental Design\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic design was to simulate a member of the morning subgroup A finding food shortly before the midday switchover, in order to investigate whether this influenced the subsequent foraging behaviour of subgroup B members. The study consisted of four stages: (1) food preference tests, (2) recording of food-specific calling sequences, (3) establishment of two feeding areas, and (4) playback experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Food preference tests\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we conducted food preference tests to identify a highly valued and a lesser-valued food. Equal sized piles of two foods were placed next to each other on the ground and the first choice was recorded for each individual, repeated across four days, once per day. For each individual, we created a preference matrix based on the percentage of trials in which each food was selected over the other food type across the four sessions. These percentages were then combined to give a cumulative preference score per food, and ranked accordingly (table S4). From eight familiar foods, kiwis and apples were consistently ranked as high and low by all individuals, while both still reliably triggering food calls. We thus selected kiwis and apples as our experimental foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Recording calls\n",
      "\n",
      "From April to May 2009, we recorded food-associated call sequences given by all individuals feeding in the outdoor enclosure (fig. 4). This allowed us to build up a sound library of call sequences given to kiwi and apples by individuals of the ‘morning’ subgroup for the subsequent playback experiments and to compare their behaviour with a previous study on bonobos [31] (table 2). We recorded vocalizations using a Sennheiser MKH816T directional microphone and a Marantz PMD660 solid-state recorder. Verbal comments were given and later transcribed. We transferred recordings onto a Toshiba Laptop (Equium 1.8 GHz) at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz with 16-bit accuracy. To control for hunger levels, novelty, and other factors, we only recorded calls produced during first morning feeds. We excluded calls produced by individuals interacting with more than one type of food or when caller identity was uncertain. Calls were recorded from a range of locations from a distance of 2–15 m.\n",

      "3. Foraging training\n",
      "\n",
      "During this same period, we established two outdoor foraging patches for the afternoon subgroup in a daily foraging task. Before their midday release, a caretaker hid finely cut pieces (1 cm2 pieces, total 300 g) of either apple or kiwi in the grass in one of two 30 m2 fields so that they were not visible from a distance. The two fields were on slopes, equidistant to the door (21 m); the distance between them was 8 m. Both field areas were equal (length top = 6.5 m; width = 4.0 m; length bottom = 8.5 m), starting with a flat descent and finishing at the concrete border of the enclosure wall. Kiwi and apple feeds were presented in random order so individuals could not predict which patch was baited so had to inspect the two areas separately. Only one food type was ever provided and no other food or enrichment was provided during training. The keeper always visited both areas, even if no food was placed, to prevent individuals from learning noises associated with scattering food. There were 16 training days for each food type, and 10 control days during which no food was provided. We filmed the individuals' foraging behaviour and kept a daily record of each individual's food encounters (text S1, table S5). Individuals soon learned the two feeding fields and quickly formed a preference for the kiwi field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Playback experiments\n",
      "\n",
      "In the final step, we conducted playback experiments in which call sequences of members of the morning subgroup were played to individuals in the afternoon subgroup (text S1). The experimental routine was as follows. Around midday, the morning subgroup was brought inside for a seed feed. Live radio broadcasting was played via an inside keeper door to prevent subjects from the morning group from hearing the stimuli (i.e. their own calls) in the subsequent experiment. This was effective as no vocal responses were elicited from any individual during playback trials (except for one apple trial, which was excluded from analysis). Meanwhile, individuals from the afternoon subgroup were waiting to be released through their own door. Beforehand, three key manipulations were carried out. First, a keeper entered the outdoor enclosure from a side door to mimic placing food (none was provisioned). Individuals were familiar with this routine from the previous foraging training. They could not see the event, but could hear the associated sounds. After the keeper's return, subjects heard the opening sounds of the door, which connected the morning subgroup to the outdoor enclosure (to suggest a re-entry of the morning subgroup), although, in reality, no subject was released. A trial was conducted only if (a) no vocalizations had been produced by the morning subgroup for at least 1 minute, (b) individuals of the afternoon subgroup were waiting close (<1–2 m) to the door and not distracted by social activities (play, agonistic, sex) for at least 1 minute; (c) there was no rain or excessive wind outdoors. Communication between a keeper who stayed indoors with the bonobos and the experimenter, who stayed outdoors, was maintained with two-way radios. If these conditions were not met, the trial was either delayed or, in some cases, abandoned. If conditions were met, the afternoon subgroup then heard a 4 s playback of a series of four equally spaced calls extracted from a natural call sequence to either apple or kiwi (to simulate a morning subgroup member finding apple or kiwi) played from their outdoor enclosure (fig. S1). During control trials, all features of the procedure remained the same except that no stimulus was played. One minute after the playback (a sufficient time period for morning subgroup to ‘return’ indoors), the afternoon subgroup was released and their foraging behaviour was monitored for up to 10 min using a camcorder with additional verbal comments. We simultaneously recorded all vocal responses with professional sound recording equipment as previously described. During experimental and control trials, no food was ever provided on either field (to rule out visually-based foraging). To reduce the possibility of extinction, we interspersed a number of refresher days between each trial, i.e. between 1–4 days during which we provided either kiwi or apple pieces on the corresponding fields in random order (N = 28 total).\n",
      "\n",
      "Zoo regulations prohibited separation of group members (due to stress provoked) so all individuals were released simultaneously into the outdoor enclosure and behavioural response measures were collected while individuals interacted with each other as a group. A total of 28 trials were conducted; three were discarded due to poor weather (preventing the bonobos from being released), one due to unexpected vocalizations (see before), and one due to a communication problem between keeper and experimenter. The remaining 23 trials consisted of N = 10 apple, N = 7 kiwi, and N = 6 control trials, which were completed by four individuals (GM, CK, KH, LU).\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining two individuals (DT, JS) were excluded. JS did not complete the training phase and was not motivated to go outdoors due to his low social rank. DT showed no evidence of having learned the food locations during the training phase and showed little interest during the playback phase, only completing 5 of 23 trials, not enough for statistical analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We extracted systematic data on three dependent variables across the different conditions: (a) patch first visited (kiwi vs. apple), (b) time spent actively foraging in each patch (time trespassing, sitting, resting, or sleeping were subtracted), (c) total number of visits per patch (N times entering and exiting the patch areas interrupted by at least one bout of foraging). Because data from individuals were interdependent (we were unable to separate individuals so all individuals foraged together), we conducted our principal analyses at the group level using the median scores for individuals combined per trial. The nature of the data distribution for this method meant that only non-parametric statistics were employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst measuring the central tendency of the group across trials reduces the problems of interdependency of the data and type-two clustering errors [34], the cost is a substantial reduction in statistical power. Furthermore, rather than using the foraging behaviours of receivers (upon which our hypothesis is based) as the unit of analysis, the unit of analysis becomes the trials in which the responses of a groups of receivers were measured. We therefore conducted a second analysis using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (Poisson distribution-log link) in order to address the problem of statistical power. The Generalised Linear Mixed Model Procedure (GLMM) is an extension of the General Linear Mixed Model, characterised by a flexible generalization of ordinary least squares regression. The procedure relaxes the assumptions of normal distribution and identity link [35], a crucial prerequisite for the ordinal data of this study. The GLMM procedure enables individual identity to be accounted for (by entering it as a random factor), although this does not completely address the problem of potential inter-dependency in the individuals' foraging decisions.\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification and protection of fish critical habitats are central to the active management of species at risk [1,2]. Generally, the spawning grounds and nursery, migration, and rearing areas on which fish species depend directly to complete their life history cycles, are identified as the critical habitats for fish species [1]. However, many fish species use different critical habitats within different life history stages [3,4]. The distance between critical habitats may extend to several hundred or thousands of kilometers. Due to environmental heterogeneity in different habitats, the fish species may exhibit plastic dietary patterns and diet shifts due to variation in the accessibility and availability of potential food sources [3,5,6]. Acquiring information on the diet shift among different habitats and identifying the habitat factors causing the diet shift helps guide appropriate conservation measures to protect fish resources [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "For many fish species, diet shifts are also closely related to behavioral and morphological changes resulting from their ontogeny [7,8,9]. Generally, ontogenetic shifts in diet between size classes or life history stages are common among fish populations [7], serving as an adaptive survival strategy for resisting environmental variability. In particular, many studies have reported that the diet shift in the development stages between juvenile and adult or during early life stages, is clearly observed or estimated [8,9]. Some studies have also found that the diet shift between young individuals or young adults and adults, occurs in certain fish species [10]. However, for certain fish species, only fully mature or spawning individuals can be found in the limited spawning grounds, the diet shifts or differences between immature and fully mature stages in the spawning grounds are poorly understood, and the diet shifts of individuals between the spawning grounds and other functional habitats are also not clear. Identifying the diet shift or differences between these immature and fully mature ontogenetic stages in the spawning grounds is very important for the full understanding of the reproductive ecology of these fish species, because it provides information about the reproductive adaptation strategy to specific habitat variability [11]. Additionally, intraspecific diet competition is common for many fish species [10,12], and knowing that the intensity of intraspecific food overlaps between immature and fully mature individuals in the spawning grounds when a large number of spawning fishes aggregate in the spawning grounds is also very important for the management and conservation of fish resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "For characterizing diet differences among different habitats and/or ontogenetic stages, stable isotope analysis (SIA) [13,14] has been widely used in recent years. SIA has been broadly employed to track food sources over long time scales. The stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) have been used most frequently. While δ13C has been used to trace the potential food sources of consumers, δ15N has been used to identify the trophic positioning of consumers, because it shows an obvious stepwise enrichment between trophic levels [14,15,16]. Based on the results of SIA, mixing models are built for estimating the proportions of source (prey) contributions to a mixture (consumer) based on biotracer data to determine diet composition, niche variation, population structure, animal movement and so on [14,17]. In recent years, Bayesian mixing models have been used most frequently, because they can improve upon simpler linear mixing models by explicitly taking into account uncertainty in source values, categorical and continuous covariates, and prior information. Depending on the R software, certain R packages (e.g., SIAR and MixSIAR), including the Bayesian mixing model, have been developed for analyzing biotracer data [17,18].\n",
      "\n",
      "Largemouth bronze gudgeon (LBG), Coreius guichenoti (Sauvage and Dabry de Thiersant, 1874), is an endemic and commercial fish species in the upper Yangtze Basin [19] that plays an important role in the transfer of energy from primary producers and consumers to top predators [20]. Due to the loss of spawning grounds and hydrologic obstructions resulting from the construction of cascaded hydropower plants on the Jinsha River (the upper segments of the upper Yangtze) beginning in 2008, this species has been listed as critically endangered on the Red List of China’s Vertebrates since 2016 [21]. The fish species spawn with drifting eggs, and their spawning grounds are only distributed in the mainstream of the middle and lower reaches of the Jinsha River as well as in the lower mainstream of the Yalong River (one of the main tributaries of the Jinsha River). Before the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in 2003, the fish species made use of two critical natural riverine areas (the spawning area and the feeding, nursery area) during their entire life history cycles. The spawning area in the Jinsha River specifically includes the river segment from Xinshi Town to Tiger Leaping Gorges Town, while the feeding and nursery area generally consist of the river segments downstream of Xinshi Town, which can extend to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (Figure 1). Compared to the feeding and nursery areas, the spawning areas generally display harsher natural habitat characteristics, for instance, higher mean flow velocity and sediment content, low primary productivity and fewer microhabitat types [22]. Since the impoundment of the TGR in 2003, a newly formed reservoir habitat has been added to the habitats of this fish species, possibly exerting important impacts on the population survival of the fish species [23]. However, little is known about the influences of TGR operation on the feeding ecology of this fish species.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the feeding ecology (e.g., food preference in different development stages) of LBG remains unclear, although the diet compositions of this species in certain non-spawning river sections have been documented [20,24,25]. In particular, the feeding habits of this species in the spawning grounds are poorly understood. Moreover, food preference, diet plasticity, and intraspecific competition in the spawning grounds remain unclear. In particular, the fully mature or spawning individuals of this species can only be found in the spawning grounds [19,26]; hence, whether the intraspecific competition in the spawning grounds occurs or is strengthened during the spawning season is still unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the present study, we first employ SIA to attain the values of δ13C and δ15N of LBG muscle tissues collected from three habitat types (spawning ground, natural riverine feeding and nursery area and TGR area) and then examine the differences in δ13C and δ15N among these three habitat types by use of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Finally, we estimate the food preference and diet plasticity by employing MixSIAR within the R software and the intraspecific competition between immature and fully mature individuals according to the SIBE (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R) procedure within the R package SIBR by combining the data with the collections of potential basal food sources in the three habitats. Based on the above analysis, we aim to answer the following questions: (1) Do diet shifts of LBG among three habitat types occur? (2) Does a diet shift of LBG between immature and fully mature individuals occur, and is the intraspecific competition between immature and fully mature individuals obvious in the spawning ground during the spawning season? (3) What are the main food sources of LBG in different habitats, and does the species display evident diet plasticity? (4) What effect has the formation of the TGR had on this species? \n",

      "2.1. Study Area\n",
      "\n",
      "The study was carried out at three sites in the Yangtze River basin representing the three habitat types of LBG (Figure 1). The spawning ground sampling site (SG) located in Jiaopingdu (Kunming, Yunnan Province) is a natural riverine segment, where the substrates are mainly composed of boulders and large gravels [27]. Due to the rapid velocity (generally >2 m/s) and high sediment concentration in the water columns year-round, this river segment generally exhibits low biomasses of plankton and zoobenthos. The natural riverine feeding and nursery area sampling site (NRFA) located in the Jiangjin site (southwestern Chongqing Municipality) is also a natural riverine segment with a wide river surface (generally >200 m in river width), exhibiting the complex flow regime and the diversified substrate combinations that are beneficial as foraging and spawning grounds for many fish species [28]. The TGR area sampling site (TGRA) located in the Fuling District (central Chongqing Municipality) is the newly formed reservoir section where the bed substrates are mainly dominated by small-diameter sands and muds and display low water flow velocity and enriched nutrient loading [23]. Before the sampling period, two vast hydropower reservoirs (the Xiangjiaba and Xiluodu Reservoirs) were filled in October 2012 and May 2013, respectively. During the filling periods of the above two reservoirs, important potamodromous fish species (including the species LBG) were captured by gillnets and hooks from the sections downstream of the Xiangjiaba Dam and then transported to the upstream of the Xiluodu Reservoir. However, no fish passage facilities were constructed on these two dams, although a feasibility analysis of fish passage construction involving these two dams had been extensively discussed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2. Sample Collection and Processing\n",
      "\n",
      "Fish sample collections in the SG, NRFA and TGRA were taken from 5 June to 16 June 2013. Care of animals used in scientific procedures was under supervision of the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Hydroecology, Ministry of Water Resources and Chinese Academy of Sciences. The survey period was during the main spawning season of LBG that produced obvious peaks in egg and larvae numbers [19]. Fish specimens were collected using gillnets with mesh sizes of 1.5, 3, 5, 5.5, 8 and 10 cm. The gillnets were usually placed in the water column from dusk until dawn depending on the fishermen’s experience. Generally, a total of 6–12 gillnets were used on each sampling day at each sampling site. For the SG site, due to the construction of cascade dams (three dams have been built downstream of the spawning grounds of LBG) in the lower reaches of the Yalong River since 2000, the LBG individuals upstream of the Jinping-II Hydropower Station (Figure 1) had difficultly passing through the three dams to the SG site [26]; hence, the fish specimens in this study area were mainly collected from the Jinsha River population. A total of 175 specimens were collected, including 68 individuals from SG, 55 from NRFA, and 52 from TGRA. All individuals were collected and measured (total length, TL; standard length, SL, measured to the nearest 1 cm) and weighed (body weight, BW, measured to the nearest 0.1 g). Simultaneously, through dissection, the gonad development of LBG was classified as six stages: (I) immature fish stage; (II) quiescent stage; (III) ripening stage; (IV) ripeness stage; (V) reproduction stage; (VI) spent stage by visual observation [29]. In this study, we defined the individuals in the IV–VI stages as fully mature individuals and the other stages as immature individuals [29]. In addition, scales from all collected fish were extracted from the area below the dorsal fin and above the lateral line as the age-determining materials [30]. The scales were first cleaned with water and NaOH, placed between two slides and then observed in the field using a SZ61TR stereo microscope (Olympus, Japan) to determine the age of each fish [30]. After removing the skins and scales, muscle tissues were taken from below the dorsal fin. These tissues were frozen and freeze-dried for 72 h and stored in glass vials at −20 °C until further analysis [31].\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time as the fish sampling, the water temperature (WT, °C), dissolved oxygen (DO, mg/L), pH, and velocity of water flow (m/s) were measured in situ using YSI 6600 (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, USA) and LGY II (Nanjing Shengrong Instrument and Equipment Inc., Nanjing, China) instruments. Samples were simultaneously used to determine chemical parameters, including total nitrogen (TN, mg/L), total phosphorus (TP, mg/L), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5, mg/L), and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn, mg/L), according to standard methods (Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water, GB3838-2002) (SEPA and AQSIQ, 2002). Based on the modified criteria of Jiang et al. [32], the predominant substrate was assigned to one of three types: (1) cobble plus boulder (CPB), (2) pebble plus gravel (PPG), or (3) sand plus silt (SPS). \n",
      "\n",
      "According to previous gut-content data [24,25], the four primary food source types (mollusks, macrocrustaceans, aquatic insect larvae and particulate organic matter (POM)) for LGB were collected at the three sampling sites during the fish sample collection. POM was collected with a phytoplankton net, and then samples were filtered using a filtration apparatus coupled to a vacuum pump and previously calcined filters (Whatman QM-A quartz-fiber filters) [33]. Macrocrustacean samples (crabs and shrimps, including Macrobrachium nipponense, Procambarus clarki, Exopalaemon modestus, Caridina and Sinopotamon) were collected using 1.5 cm mesh nylon trap nets. Mollusks (snails and Limnoperna fortunei) were collected using Peterson samplers in areas of slack water or directly by hand from submerged rocks in the sampling section [20]. Mollusk specimens were placed in aerated distilled water overnight to eliminate intestinal contents, and their shells and soft tissue were then collected [20]. Aquatic insect larvae, mainly composed of species of Trichoptera, Odonata and Ephemerida, were captured from shoal areas using hand nets [20]. A total of 7 mollusks, 11 macrocrustaceans, 10 aquatic insect larvae and 6 POM samples were collected in SG. A total of 10 mollusks, 9 crustaceans, 11 aquatic insect larvae and 6 POM samples were collected in NRFA. In total, 8 mollusks, 12 crustaceans, 12 aquatic insect larvae and 6 POM samples were collected in TGRA. All collected samples of potential food sources were frozen at −20 °C in the field, sealed in Styrofoam containers and transported to the laboratory for further processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "All samples were dried at 60 °C for 24 h in an air-circulated oven, after which lipids were removed by extracting the samples in chloroform-methanol 2:1 by volume overnight at room temperature [34]. These samples were then independently homogenized using a mortar and pestle and then weighed to the appropriate mass for SIA [31]. Approximately 2 mg powder was weighed and encapsulated for animal samples, whereas 15–30 mg was taken for POM. The δ13C and δ15N were measured using an IsoPrime100 stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer equipped with a vario PYRO cube elemental analyzer (Environmental Stable Isotope Lab., Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing) and expressed as parts per thousand (‰) relative to standards. The Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite and atmospheric N2 were used as the standards for carbon and nitrogen, respectively [33].\n",

      "\n",
      "2.3. Data Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was first used to determine whether δ13C and δ15N values varied significantly among the three habitat types [35]. Prior to the ANOVA, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the Bartlett test were conducted. To meet these two test requirements, the parameters (δ13C and δ15N values) were transformed by dividing by the respective minimum value. If significance was detected, the Tukey multiple comparison test was conducted, or a nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test was conducted. Following the gonadal examination, the samples in the SG were classified as two ontogenetic stages, including the fully matured stage (FMS) and the immature stage (IS). The independent-samples t test was chosen to identify the differences in δ13C and δ15N values between FMS and IS, revealing the diet differences between immature individuals and fully mature individuals in the SG. \n",
      "\n",
      "The SIBER procedure (Stable isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R) [36] within the R package SIAR [37] was applied for examining variation in the trophic niche among the three habitat types (SG, NRFA and TGRA) and between the two ontogenetic stages (FMS and IS). The SIBER procedure is based on the concept that multiple stable isotope ratios measured from consumers represent niche dimensions, and broadly varying stable isotope ratios are indicative of a wider consumer isotopic niche. Here, we used Bayesian Standard Area Ellipses (SEAB, also called isotopic niches area) for comparing individual groups with each other and the Monte Carlo Markov-Chain simulation for constructing ellipses characterizing isotopic variation that provide a robust indicator of isotope niche width [14]. Simultaneously, by calculating the probabilities from posterior distributions of the parameters of model given the prior data, the differences in SEAB between different groups were estimated. To conduct these comparisons, the maximum-likelihood-based probabilities were calculated [14].\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR [38] was used to determine the likely contribution of potential food sources to the diets of LBG in three habitat types (SG, NRFA and TGRA) and in two ontogenetic stages (FMS and IS). The MixSIAR model is written in the open-source language R. In this model, the values of two biotracers (δ13C and δ15N) of the 175 collected LBG individuals were used as the mixture data, the mean values and standard deviations of δ13C and δ15N in the four potential foods as the food source data, and the discrimination data were acquired by referring to published literature that involved the study areas of this paper [20,39]. The habitat type or the ontogenetic stage in the spawning ground in this model was considered as the fixed effect, because the diet of each group was separately estimated, rather than the overall diet [38]. Prior to model analysis, we first plotted consumer and source isotope data to ensure that the source data bound the consumer data and then used the diagnostic tests (Gelmin-Rubin and Geweke) and trace plots to examine the model convergence [38]. Finally, the proportional contributions of each potential food estimated from the mixing models were reported as range estimates rather than limited to the mean to avoid misrepresenting the uniqueness of the results [40]. \n",

      "4. Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous studies found that differences in diet were strongly related to variations in physical and chemical parameters at different ecological scales [3,33]. In the present study, significant variation existed in the isotope signatures of LBG muscle tissues among three highly heterogeneous habitats, indicating an obvious diet shift among three habitats (SG, NRFA and TGRA). This finding indicated that habitat attributes played an important role in the diet composition of LBG. In particular, the diet shift between NRFA and TGRA showed that the newly-formed reservoir can obviously influence the diet composition of LBG. In addition, the diet shifts among the three habitat types may highlight the importance of maintaining habitat connectivity between different habitat types when considering the completeness of the life cycle. Due to the high velocity of water flow (generally >2 m/s, Table 2), the SG displayed low primary productivity and only provided limited foods for LBG, while the NRFA and TGRA showed relatively low water flow velocity and enriched nutrient levels [23], which can support the survival and maturation of more individuals. The movement between habitats may be a life history strategy for long-term adaptation to environmental variation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many studies have also documented that diet shift for a given fish was closely associated with maturation and spawning [42,43]. Fuiman and Faulk [44] even found that the diet shift in a marine batch-spawning fish could impact the transfer of arachidonic acid from diet to egg. However, in the present study, the results provided no statistical support for the difference in δ13C values between immature and fully mature stages in SG, but a significant difference in δ15N values between these two stages was detected. These results might imply that for LBG, the diet shift or the difference between immature and fully mature stages was not obvious even though the food intake of these two developmental stages was different. In addition, the individuals investigated in this study only included the young, subadult and adult individuals but did not include larvae or juvenile stages because of the lack of distribution of these life stages in spawning grounds. Gao et al. [45] reported that a large number of larvae and juveniles of LBG could be collected only downstream of Xinshi Town (Figure 1). \n",
      "\n",
      "Previous studies have used muscle tissue to study the isotopic shift between ontogenetic stages (particularly during early ontogeny) [7,8]. In the present study, we used muscle tissue to compare the isotopic difference between immature and fully mature stages based upon a complete investigation of the life history characters of LBG. LBG is a long-lived fish species, and its growth inflexion age is 8.13 years [46], indicating that fish individuals collected in this study (Table 1, age range 3–6 years) still exhibited a rapid growth speed. Thus, sufficient nutrients were available to these individuals to meet growth needs. Additionally, LBG produces eggs and spawns many times in its life [26]; therefore, this species must allocate enough nutrients to muscle tissue in order to adapt to the harsh conditions (e.g., high stream velocity and low diet biomass) of the spawning grounds. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many migratory fishes typically move or migrate to the spawning grounds with limited areas for spawning [47,48], resulting in an obvious increase in population density in spawning grounds during the spawning seasons. This behavior likely intensifies the competition among individuals for foods. In particular, for certain fish that spawn in the upper segments of one large river (with limited food availability), their spawning aggregations may lead to the more serious food shortages to the presence of local populations of the same fish species [49]. Our study showed no significant differences in isotopic niche width between immature and fully mature individuals in SG, indicating the same prey sources for individuals of these two ontogenetic stages. Obviously, marked intraspecific food competition and similar feeding ecology existed between these two ontogenetic stages. Additionally, this finding suggested relatively limited aggregation times of LBG reproductive cohorts in the spawning ground, because of the very similar ecological niche between immature and fully mature individuals and limited food availability in the spawning ground. Fish aggregate when spawning and leave after spawning. Tao et al. [50] reported that LBG aggregated into the spawning grounds for spawning during the flood and departed after spawning. In this context, maintaining the undisturbed state of LBG spawning grounds during the spawning season is vital for the protection of this fish species. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a longstanding argument about the diet preference of LBG. Huang and Deng [24] and Liu et al. [25] found that LBG was an omnivorous fish with carnivorous preference by using stomach content analysis (SCA) based on the samples from two feeding grounds of LBG, while Li et al. [20] used stable isotope analysis (SIA) and found that LBG was an omnivorous fish with phytophagous preference based upon the samples from another feeding ground of LBG. Our results confirmed that LBG was an omnivorous fish with a carnivorous preference based upon the samples collected across all critical habitat types. Our results were consistent with the SCA results [24,25], but were obviously different from the SIA results [20]. This difference in SIA results possibly resulted from the differences in sample processing and statistical methods. Li et al. [20] did not remove lipids in sample processing and used the IsoSource software for determining the likely contribution of potential food sources to the diets of LBG, both of which likely produced obvious deviations from the true values. Post et al. [51] noted that the lipids in samples should be removed when the C/N ratio of samples is >4 because a high lipid content possibly affects the δ13C value. Moore and Semmens [17] determined that although the IsoSource model can address the uncertainty associated with more sources than an analytical solution, it does not formally incorporate the variation in isotope signatures or fractionation. When used to analyze the same data, IsoSource generally obtained different results from the MixSIAR model [17]. Many studies have suggested that a combination of SCA and SIA is more suitable than using SCA alone to determine temporal and regional variations in the diet compositions of certain fish species [52,53]. However, in view of the uneven digestion and assimilation rates of different potential foods [53], we chose the SIA for determining the potential food sources of LBG. In addition, our findings demonstrated that the determination of diet for a fish species, especially the food preference of an omnivorous species, must include analysis across all critical habitats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our MixSIAR output indicated that POM was the dominant food source for LBG in the spawning ground (SG), while macrocrustaceans and POM were the major diet components for LBG in the feeding and nursery ground (NRFA). In particular, macrocrustaceans constituted the highest proportion of the LBG diet in NRFA. This finding implied that diet plasticity occurred from the spawning ground to the feeding and nursery ground. This fish species can change its feeding behavior by adapting to the food species composition in the surrounding environment. The main food sources of LBG became macrocrustaceans and mollusks when LBG entered the TGR, further confirming the dietary plasticity of LBG. Furthermore, the isotopic niche widths became wider from the spawning ground to the river section of the reservoir area. These results indicate that downstream feeding grounds, especially the reservoir area, can provide more diversified and abundant food sources. This variation pattern seems common in many fish populations of dietary specialists [54,55], which is possibly an adaptation mechanism for decreasing mortality at the early life history stage. LBG spawn pelagic eggs in resource-limited areas, but its larvae and juveniles grow up in areas with abundant food [19]. This condition is likely a typical case for obtaining the optimal habitat suitability by diet plasticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to immature individuals, the fully mature individuals feed on higher proportions of aquatic insect larvae, macrocrustaceans and mollusks, although the difference between these two groups of individuals was not significant. This possibly resulted from the size-related difference [7]. In this study, the body sizes of fully mature individuals were obviously larger than those of immature individuals, implying that fully mature individuals likely exhibit a greater ability to feed on larger sizes of macrocrustaceans and mollusks. However, the POM still played a very important role in the spawning ground, suggesting the importance of the inputs of terrestrial organic detritus into the upper segments of the river [56] because these river segments generally displayed low concentrations of autochthonous algae and endogenous organic detritus [57].\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the isotope niche width of LBG individuals in the reservoir area was broader than that of both other sampling sites. The results showed that the individuals in the reservoir area fed more heavily on higher-order consumers, suggesting an important function of the newly formed reservoir area as the feeding grounds of LBG. However, there are seventeen very large dams in operation, under construction, or planned, on the mainstem of the upper Yangtze River [57]. This activity will inevitably block the migratory routes of LBG from the feeding and nursery grounds to the spawning grounds, inducing a partial or even total loss of the spawning grounds upstream of Xiludu Dam [57]. Although certain sections of TGR (in particular of the tail of the reservoir) can serve as the feeding grounds of LBG, they cannot function as the spawning area [19]. Therefore, maintaining habitat connectivity between the TGR and the spawning grounds in the Jinsha River is very important for the survival and long-term persistence of LBG. Hence, fish passage facilities, especially upstream facilities, should be constructed in the dams downstream of LBG spawning grounds. \n",

      "5. Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "This study of the diet shifts of a critically endangered fish species among three habitat types (SG, NRFA and TGRA) and between two ontogenetic stages (FMS and IS) showed that an obvious diet shift existed among three habitat types, but not between ontogenetic stages. Our results determined the food preference of LBG and confirmed the serious intraspecific competition between immature and fully matured individuals in a resource-limited area, both of which can guide future work conducted in captive breeding (aiming to restore the wild population of LBG via artificial release) of LBG. The results also showed that the formation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in the upper Yangtze River altered the trophic structure, likely providing more high-quality food organisms. However, due to the cascade hydropower construction of the Jinsha River, it is necessary to maintain the habitat connectivity between the TGR and the spawning grounds in the Jinsha River for LBG survival and persistence over the long term [57]. In this context, the construction of fish passage facilities in the downstream LBG spawning grounds in the lower reaches of the Jinsha River should be implemented in the near future. In addition, due to significant differences in diet compositions among different critical habitats, a sufficiently broad view of trophic ecology, especially in regard to the food preference of a single fish species, made it clear that the effects of habitat types must be fully investigated. \n",

      "\n",
      "Understanding temporal stability of genetic structure and diversity is crucial for the utility of temporal snapshots in conservation management and to infer how climate-induced range shifts might affect the future distribution and adaptive potential of species. In trailing edge populations, effective population size and genetic diversity are considered major keys to adaptive potential and subsequent persistence under climate change [1, 2]. In contrast, the evolutionary potential and survival of low-diversity leading edge populations [3] may be either enhanced or impaired by the ‘surfing’ of new mutations that can rapidly increase in frequency over iterated founder events, depending on whether the new mutations are primarily favorable or deleterious [4–9].\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies that assess temporal genetic stability are rare in marine species, and mostly confined to fisheries management to ensure sustainable exploitation of economically important species [10–14]. While high gene flow explained 5 to 24-year long stability in genetic variability and structure in Chinook salmon and Atlantic herring [10, 11], large fluctuations in allele frequencies were recorded over a few months in small and closed populations of the intertidal isopod Jaera albifrons [15]. However, high gene flow does not always warrant temporal genetic stability, as several marine species with long-lived planktonic larvae showed stronger temporal than spatial differentiation over 3 to 9 years [16–18]. On the other hand, low gene flow does not necessarily result in genetic instability over time, although genetic drift in small and closed populations can be expected to be high. For example, genetic diversity and population structure remained stable over 5–12 years in relatively closed populations of the seagrass Zostera marina [19] and over 2 years in nine out of 10 locally differentiated populations of the isopod Excirolana braziliensis [20]. These contrasting results demonstrate that a species’ life history alone does not necessarily predict its genetic stability over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to their high sensitivity to rising temperatures, responses of marine intertidal species are considered as early warning signals for the impact of climate change [21–25]. Among global climate change factors, ocean warming is considered the most severe threat for marine macrophytes [26–28]. Over the next century, ecological niche models predict the disappearance of intertidal fucoid brown algae along their southern trailing edges and a poleward extension of their northern leading edges [26, 29]. Fucoid brown algae (Heterokontophyta; Fucaceae) are habitat-forming ecosystem engineers supporting species-rich intertidal communities along temperate rocky shores [30–33]. Thus, range shifts of fucoids will undoubtedly trigger major ecological changes along temperate rocky shores of the North Atlantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ecological niche models, however, do not consider the species’ plastic and adaptive potential that could mitigate the predicted northward shifts. Adaptive potential depends largely on a population’s genetically effective size, Ne [34], or the size of an ideal population that undergoes the same rate of genetic change as the real population [35]. At low Ne, and low gene flow between populations, genetic drift generally plays the predominant role, effectively neutralizing selection, and eroding genetic diversity through stochastic fixation or loss of allelic variations [36–38]. Although Ne and temporal stability of genetic diversity patterns are particularly important for restoration and conservation efforts of fucoid seaweeds, only a single Norwegian population of F. serratus has so far been assessed [39].\n",
      "\n",
      "The canopy-forming seaweed F. serratus is an excellent model for the study of temporal evolution and stability of genetic structure and diversity across a range of contrasting temperature regimes. It is one of the dominant intertidal seaweeds along the Northeast-Atlantic rocky shore from northern Portugal to northern Norway [40]. Arctic regions are predicted to become thermally suitable through 2100 under CO2 emission scenario projections [26]. In contrast, regions south of the Brittany coast of France are predicted to become unsuitable [26], as temperatures will rise beyond the species’ potential for thermal acclimatization [41]. The susceptibility of F. serratus to climate change is expected to vary regionally, given the species’ regional patterns of genetic diversity [42], in combination with low gene flow between local populations [43].\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic diversity of F. serratus is highest in the two former, large glacial refugia (20–18 thousand years ago (kya)) in Southwest Ireland, and Brittany [42, 43]. The third refugium in the Northwest Iberian peninsula is characterized by a high proportion of private alleles, and currently represents the species’ isolated trailing edge, where recurrent cycles of thermally induced extinction and recolonization have eroded genetic diversity [42, 43]. Currently, sea surface temperatures reach 22 °C, and although below the lethal limit of F. serratus (25 °C) [40, 44], inhibit growth, physiological performance and reproductive capacity [45–48].\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic diversity of F. serratus decreases from its mid-range of distribution towards higher latitudes and is lowest in leading edge populations in northern Norway [42, 43]. Low genetic diversity in leading-edge populations is explained by the populations’ relatively young age and their derivation from small founder populations that carried only a subset of the genetic variation from glacial refugia to the north after the ice retreated, ca. 15–10 kya.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Ne is a good indicator for temporal genetic stability, its estimation relies on temporally-spaced genetic data [49]. Due to this complication in sampling design, Ne of F. serratus has been estimated in only a single population close to Bergen (Norway) over eight years [39]. The estimated Ne between 73 and 386 was regarded insufficient for long-term survival under environmental change [39]. However, a thorough appraisal of the spatial distribution and temporal stability of Ne and genetic diversity throughout the species’ latitudinal range of distribution cannot be inferred from a single location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimating climate change susceptibility in a species with low gamete/zygote dispersal requires to assess temporal genetic stability across its latitudinal and thermal range of distribution. In this study, we estimated Ne of F. serratus across latitude and temperature at seven locations with decadal sampling (2000 and 2010), a period in which Europe experienced three heat waves in 2003, 2006, and 2010 [50–52]. Here we evaluate whether range shifts in the north or strong selection pressures in the south have resulted in measurable changes in genetic diversity and population structure. In populations that are dominated by genetic drift and with small adaptive potential, we expected to find a decline in genetic diversity over the past decade. Finally, we discuss whether genetic diversity may be sufficiently stable to buffer environmental change and mitigate the current range shift predictions.\n",

      "The spatial distribution of genetic diversity has important implications for conservation and management as it reveals a species’ strong and weak points with regards to stability and evolutionary capacity [72–74]. Given the key ecological role of F. serratus [30–32, 75–77], the positive effect of genetic diversity may reach beyond the species level to affect community structure and increase species richness and stability of the entire associated ecosystem [78–81]. We are not aware of seaweed studies that have investigated positive ecosystem effects of genetic diversity, but genetic diversity enhanced heat-stress survival in germlings of Fucus vesiculosus [27]. Furthermore, in the habitat forming seagrass Z. marina, genotypic diversity not only enhanced biomass production, but also abundance of the associated fauna under near-lethal water temperatures [82] and community resistance to grazing [83]. Thus, maintaining genetic diversity in F. serratus is also expected to be important for conservation and management of the entire intertidal ecosystem along temperate rocky shores. Across the latitudinal range of F. serratus, genetic diversity and differentiation remained stable for 5–10 generations at regional scales, and in all but the Norwegian region at local spatial scales (Figs. 2, 3, 4). This suggests that, despite low gene flow between populations, effective population sizes have remained large enough to maintain genetic variation at least on the short term. Temporal genetic differentiation was systematically lower than local differentiation, and 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than regional differentiation (Additional file 9). This implies that temporal snapshots provide valuable information for conservation management of fucoid seaweeds, as they reliably reflect diversity and differentiation patterns for at least a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ne comparisons\n",
      "\n",
      "In all but the Norwegian populations, Ne was estimated as > 260, a size reported as the median estimate for stable populations in over 83 studies spanning a diverse range of taxa [36]. This suggests low sensitivity to genetic stochasticity [36] in all but the northern edge populations of F. serratus. As in most studies, the precision of Ne decreased as Ne increased (Fig. 5) [36, 84, 85]. Local differentiation in F. serratus is one of the most important assumptions of the employed ‘temporal’ method to estimate Ne, in which neutral genetic change over time is expected to be inversely proportional to Ne. Discrete generations are another important assumption of the ‘temporal’ method. Overlapping generations are unlikely to cause a significant downward bias of Ne when more than 4 generations lie between the temporal samples [49]. This can be expected for most of our temporal samples, assuming a generation time of 1–2 years [65, 86] and a time span of 6–11 years between sampling. Thus, our sample-size-corrected estimates can be regarded as unbiased and indicative of a ‘real’ decline in Ne from the species’ mid-range of distribution to its range-edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Ne > 1000, as in the French ‘Ile de Siec’ population, is large enough to ensure evolutionary potential in perpetuity [87], and is likely to provide the best source for adaptive genetic rescue of threatened and declining populations [38, 88]. However, large Ne estimates are commonly associated with a high uncertainty [36, 85]. Accordingly, the point estimate of Ne in the ‘Ile de Siec’ population (ca. 10 Million) has a wide confidence interval as compared with the other populations (Fig. 5, Additional file 7). Consequently, the point estimate is unlikely to be the true value in this population, but is certainly > 1000, and higher than in any other measured populations. The reason for this outlier value is not due to high diversity, since this is comparable to the other French population (Fig. 4a-d), but the high stability in allele frequencies over time. Indeed, the ‘Ile de Siec’ population was the only population for which temporal genetic differentiation was non-significant (Additional file 7).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ne in the other mid-range populations, > 500, may be sufficient in the mid-term [36, 87, 89] to mitigate the predicted extinction by the end of the twenty-first century [26]. However, given that summer temperatures are predicted to rise above the thermal tolerance limit of F. serratus in Brittany within the next 200 years [26, 41], it is important to track its fitness in this region in order to implement early conservation measures in case it loses its current stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Ne of 50–100 was regarded necessary for a population to minimize inbreeding depression and associated problems such as accumulation of deleterious mutations and loss of variation [36, 87]. However, despite Ne < 60 in the Norwegian ‘Grense Jakobselv’ population, genetic diversity remained stable for both Norwegian populations over six years and neither population was inbred. In contrast, a previous study on a southern Norwegian population reported significant loss of Ne from 2000 to 2008 and concluded that an Ne between 73 and 386 was insufficient for long-term survival under environmental change [39]. Stable diversity despite small Ne in our two northern Norwegian populations may be ascribed to regional gene flow, suggested by a reduction in genetic differentiation between the two Norwegian populations from 2004 to 2010 and significant outbreeding (negative FIS) in the ‘Kirkenes’ population in 2010. Thus, regional gene flow may uncouple Ne from genetic stochasticity effects at the species’ Northern edge of distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Diversity comparisons\n",
      "\n",
      "As expected for neutral loci, genetic diversity was positively related with Ne [36, 38]. Both regional and local diversities are highest in Brittany and make the range-center of F. serratus less sensitive to genetic drift [36, 37]. A decline in genetic diversity towards the northern and southern range-edges is in accordance with the species’ biogeographic history [42].\n",
      "\n",
      "Low genetic diversity does not necessarily lower the evolutionary potential of F. serratus to adapt to Arctic shores [26]. The evolutionary potential, survival, and expansion rate of low-diversity leading edge populations [3] may decrease when deleterious mutations accumulate at expansion range fronts and create a so-called ‘expansion load’ [7, 9]. On the other hand, survival may well be enhanced by the ‘surfing’ of favorable mutations that can rapidly increase in frequency over iterated founder events [4, 5, 90]. An additional consideration is that source populations of Arctic colonists may not be located at the species’ northern edge, but within European harbors with frequent shipping, fishing, and cruise boat traffic to and from the northern polar regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our results have clear implications for the conservation of F. serratus at its southern edge. Reductions in MLH from 1999 to 2010 were close to significant (p = 0.0051/0.134 for Ribadeo2/Ribadeo1, respectively), although, Hexp, α, and FIS remained temporally stable. This agrees with stability of Hexp and α over 7–9 years in fragmented southern edge populations of the kelp species Laminaria digitata [91], and is likely due to the measures’ insensitivity to the effects of population bottlenecks [92]. In other words, while the polymorphic state of loci and the diversity of alleles did not decline, alleles occurred more frequently in a homozygous state in the recent samples. In theory, the decline in MLH might be explained by increased selection pressure for heat-tolerance, although there is only indirect experimental evidence for this. Acclimation potential to further thermal stress is likely impeded in this population by chronically high expression of heat shock protein genes [22, 23, 41, 93]. Between 2000 and 2010, the Ribadeo1 population experienced a 90% decline in abundance [26]. Although stable local differentiation favors ecotypic differentiation in thermal stress tolerance [41], heat-stress is becoming too extreme at the southern edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The value of conserving the southern edge of F. serratus may be high [94]. Because of its separation from Brittany by the uninhabitable sandy warm shores of the Bay of Biscay, the Northwest Iberian glacial refugium did not contribute to postglacial recolonizations of ice-free northern shores, and, thus, preserves unique genetic variation [42]. The conservation value of the species’ southern edge becomes even more apparent when considering that small-scale population structure increases the species’ regional diversity above local diversity within single populations (Additional file 8). High regional diversity, despite low within-population diversity, was previously reported for the southern distribution edge of the seagrass Zostera marina [94, 95]. We are not aware of studies that explicitly addressed this effect in macroalgae, although increased local differentiation at the southern edge of the kelp Laminaria digitata [91] can be expected to increase regional variation as well. Thus, with the loss of its southern edge, the species’ can be expected to lose its most heat-adapted populations sustaining unique genetic variation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "Temporal snapshots of genetic diversity and structure in F. serratus populations spanning its latitudinal range reliably reflect patterns across local and regional spatial scales and across various thermal backgrounds for at least one decade. Stable small-scale structure enhances regional genetic diversity throughout the species’ range of distribution and is a potential driver for local adaptation [36] that may explain species radiation and diversity in the genus Fucus [96–98].\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MLH appears to be the most stress-sensitive measure of diversity, displaying a strong decline at the species’ southern edge of distribution. As sandy warm shores separate the Iberian southern edge from the genetically diverse Brittany region, genetic rescue by the influx of genetic variation [38, 88] might only be possible if initiated by conservation efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increasing temperatures are likely the major cause for the decline not only of F. serratus, but also other intertidal and subtidal macroalgae in Northwest Iberia [28, 99–101], as well as temperate seaweeds worldwide [102]. Kelp species may maintain genetic diversity to a certain degree in southern edges by escaping to deep-water refugia to avoid rising temperatures in shallow waters [103]. Accordingly, in Northern Portugal, increasing air-temperature stress depresses the upper boundary limit of F. serratus [104]. However, intertidal seaweeds are less adapted to low light conditions and, thus, have low potential to escape into deeper waters. Another factor that impedes survival of southern edge populations in fucoid seaweeds is their reproductive strategy with fewer gametes and lower dispersal (< 12 m from parental sites [45, 46]) as compared with kelps that release billions of spores dispersing several kilometers [105, 106]. We suspect that without the influx of genetic variation from Brittany, intertidal habitat-forming macroalgae, such as F. serratus, may largely disappear from southern edges but retain potential to persist in small subtidal bottleneck populations in cool upwelling regions [107].\n",

      "Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are viewed as being incapable of mounting lengthy axon regeneration. Using whole tissue immunolabeling, we establish a technique to visualize and trace the entire paths of small populations of genetically labeled RGC axons as they regenerate. Following optic nerve injury, few axons grow beyond the lesion, but we find these axons branch and form loops proximal to the lesion. A regeneration inducing treatment further exacerbates branching and tortuous growth, while only modestly increasing the number of RGC axons that successfully grow beyond the lesion. Our study demonstrates extensive and circuitous RGC axon elongation both in pre- and post-lesion regions, highlighting the need to better understand the factors that inhibit direct axon growth in the optic nerve.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of axon regeneration is a major obstacle preventing functional recovery after axon injury. Like other neurons in the CNS, it is thought that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) have a limited ability to regenerate spontaneously. Nonetheless, growth factors or modification of genes promote RGC axonal regeneration, to some extent. For example, supplying RGCs with cytokines, or genetic modification of Pten, Pcaf, Stat3, Socs3, c-Myc, dcxl, or Klf4 allows some RGC axons to regenerate with few axons reaching the brain targets (Park et al., 2008; Moore et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009; Puttagunta et al., 2014; Belin et al., 2015; Nawabi et al., 2015; Leibinger et al., 2016; Mehta et al., 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple reports have demonstrated that some regenerating RGC axons travel circuitously within the optic nerve after intraorbital crush injury (Luo et al., 2013; Pernet et al., 2013). However, these studies have used anterograde tracers that label all RGC axons, making it difficult to identify individual fibers and visualize how axons of different RGC types behave as they regenerate. Here we sought to combine sparse neuronal labeling with the immunolabeling-enabled 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO) technique (Renier et al., 2016) and trace the entire path of individual axons as they regenerate.\n",
      "\n",
      "RGCs are a heterogeneous population of neurons. They are divided into several subclasses based on their morphologic, physiologic, and molecular properties. Previous studies have shown that different RGC types differ in their ability to regenerate axons. For instance, studies in cats have shown that αRGCs regenerate axons better than other RGC types (Watanabe and Fukuda, 2002). Similarly, in mice it was demonstrated that αRGCs have greater propensity to regenerate axons after crush injury (Duan et al., 2015). RGCs in the Thy1-H-YFP mouse line have a “Golgi-like” labeling, allowing for the characterization of their dendrites and axons. Importantly, this line labels few RGCs, most of which are immune-positive for SMI-32, a marker of αRGCs (Feng et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2004; Coombs et al., 2006).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, we first validate that the Thy1-H-YFP mouse sparsely labels αRGCs. We used a combination of confocal imaging and iDISCO to analyze the dendrites and axons of the labeled neurons. We find that, after optic nerve crush, (1) αRGC dendrites decrease in complexity, and the dendritic arbors are even less complex in animals treated with an axon growth promoting-stimulator (i.e., CNTF); (2) innately, axons remodel and regrow extensively proximal to the crush site; and (3) following CNTF, axon elongation is extremely circuitous, and these axons never reach the brain, despite growing distances that would allow them to reach the brain, had they grown straight. Overall, our results show that RGCs can re-extend axons very well, even in the absence of a growth stimulator, but their inability to traverse the lesion area along with meandering axon growth limit “meaningful” regeneration, dramatically reducing the number of RGCs successfully regenerating axons into the brain. Our results shift the focus from promoting axon elongation, to understanding factors that prevent direct growth of CNS axons through the injured nerve.\n",

For retinal whole mount staining, the retina was carefully dissected out of the globe and derestricting cuts were placed in each quadrant. Tissue was washed with PBS and blocked in 5% normal donkey serum (Sigma D9663) in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST). Tissue was then incubated in blocking buffer containing primary antibodies, overnight at 4°C.

Following incubation with primary antibody, tissue was washed extensively in PBST. Tissue was then incubated in blocking buffer containing secondary antibodies 1:500, overnight at 4°C.

      "The number of YFP+ RGCs per retina was quantified from low-magnification z-stack images that tiled the entire retina using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope. RGCs were defined by: soma location in the ganglion cell layer or inner nuclear layer (displaced RGC), and the presence of an axon. To determine the subtype of YFP+ RGCs, every YFP+ RGC in a retina was assessed for immunoreactivity with a RGC subtype marker: OSPN, Opn4, or CART (see Results for n number of retinas assessed for each marker). Survival of YFP+ RGCs was determined as the number of YFP+ RGCs remaining or the percentage of YFP+ RGCs remaining compared to the uninjured contralateral retina. To analyze RGC dendrites, high-magnification z-stack images were taken of individual RGCs from the retinal nerve fiber layer to the inner nuclear layer. Images were tiled and reconstructed if a RGC’s dendrites extended out of field. Dendrites were traced using ImageJ/FIJI and the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin (Longair et al., 2011; Schindelin et al., 2012). Linear Sholl analysis was completed using the Sholl analysis plugin for ImageJ/FIJI (Ferreira et al., 2014). Sholl analysis data were analyzed as the average number of intersections observed in radii bins of 30 µm. Data were preprocessed using R 3.3.1 (https://cran.r-project.org/).\n",

      "\n",
      "To visualize and track the growth of individual axons in the unsectioned mouse optic nerve we used the Thy1-H-YFP transgenic mouse line, which sparsely labels RGCs, including the regeneration competent αRGCs (Feng et al., 2000; Coombs et al., 2006; Duan et al., 2015). We observed that there are ∼70 YFP+ RGCs in each flat-mounted retina of an adult Thy1-H-YFP mouse (n = 9 retina). While the number of YFP+ RGCs per retina varies between animals (σ = 21), there is a strong correlation (R2 = 0.9943, p < 0.05, n = 3 pairs of retina) between the left and right retina of an animal. To determine what portion of these YFP+ RGCs are αRGCs, we immunostained the retinas with an antibody against OSPN, a molecular marker of αRGCs (Duan et al., 2015; Sanes and Masland, 2015). We found that ∼70% of YFP+ RGCs are immunoreactive for OSPN (Fig. 1). To further define the molecular identity of YFP+ RGCs, we stained the retinas with antibodies against OPN4 (a marker of intrinsically photosensitive RGCs) and CART (a marker of direction selective RGCs). Very few YFP+ RGCs were immunoreactive for OPN4 (i.e., <2% of total YFP+ RGCs) or CART (i.e., <10% of total YFP+ RGCs; Fig. 1A–G). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Thy1-H-YFP mouse line sparsely labels RGCs, which are primarily OSPN+.\n",

      "To examine the fate of YFP+ RGCs in response to axon injury, we performed intraorbital optic nerve crush and evaluated their survival in the presence or absence of a growth promoting factor (Fig. 2A–H,J). Six weeks postcrush, ∼13 YFP+ RGCs survived (Fig. 2J, 6wpc). Of these, ∼10 were OSPN+ RGCs, which represents ∼76% of total remaining YFP+ RGCs (Fig. 2J). Several studies have shown that virally transferred CNTF promotes RGC survival and axon regeneration. AAV2 expressing a secreted form of CNTF did not alter the survival of YFP+ and YFP+/OSPN+ RGCs (Fig. 2J, CNTF + 6wpc). These data show that the majority of surviving YFP+ RGCs in the Thy1-H-YFP mouse are αRGCs. These findings underscore the utility of the Thy1-H-YFP mouse line for studying axon regeneration in a small number of regeneration competent RGCs, and establishes the feasibility of examining how a specific RGC type will behave after injury and CNTF.\n",

      "In addition to investigating the survival of YFP+ RGCs, we examined the changes in dendrite morphology following intraorbitral optic nerve crush. Again, we focused on YFP+ αRGCs (i.e., YFP+/OSPN+ RGCs). Representative images of YFP+/OSPN+ RGCs and their dendrites in uninjured and injured (6wpc) animals are shown in Figures 1D’–F’, 2C–E,I, respectively. At six weeks following injury, we did not observe a significant change in dendritic field area or the number of primary dendrites compared to uninjured animals (Fig. 2K,L). Sholl analysis, which is commonly used to evaluate dendritic field arrangement and density (Sholl, 1953), shows that there is a significant reduction in dendrite complexity following intraorbital crush (Fig. 2M, uninjured versus 6wpc, *p < 0.05). AAV-CNTF and crush injury (CNTF + 6wpc) resulted in RGCs that have fewer primary dendrites and less complex dendritic arbors than injury alone (Fig. 2K–M, #p < 0.05 6wpc vs CNTF + 6wpc; statistically significant difference detected at 30- to 90-µm radii but no other radii). Thus, these results indicate that acute optic nerve injury leads to reduction in αRGCs’ dendritic complexity, and CNTF plus injury causes an even further reduction of dendritic complexity in these neurons.\n",

Sparsely labeled individual YFP+ RGC axons are clearly visible. These axons project linearly from the optic disk to the distal optic nerve. In rare occasions, we also noticed that some axons have a short, rapidly terminating branch (Fig. 3F,G). We also observed occasional YFP+ cells and their processes in the optic nerve.

Furthermore, we find a strong correlation between the number of RGCs and axons (R2 = 0.9975, p < 0.0001, n = 5 retina, optic nerve pairs; Fig. 3H), and on average we identified 98.5% of the axons predicted by the number of YFP+ RGCs.

      "To examine the morphology and growth pattern of YFP+ RGC axons following crush injury, first we collected Thy1-H-YFP mouse optic nerves 3dpc and performed iDISCO and 3D confocal imaging (Fig. 4B,C). To determine how an individual axon regenerates, we traced entire axons of some RGCs (Fig. 4B,C). Additionally, to visualize all RGC axons, CTB conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 was injected 1 h after crush to label axons anterogradely. Even at this early stage (i.e., 3dpc; Fig. 4C, n = 4), some axons regrew within a small area near the cut end. However, there were no axons beyond the lesion site. Axons in the animals subjected to AAV-CNTF and crush injury (CNTF + 3dpc, n = 4) appear similar at this time point (Fig. 4B). Disconnected YFP+ axons which have not yet undergone Wallerian degeneration are visible distal to the lesion site (Fig. 4B,C, arrows indicate disconnected bulbs). All YFP+ axons are clearly disconnected, and no CTB labeled axons are found far distal to the lesion site (i.e., 1 mm distal to lesion site), strongly indicating that the injury is complete and no axons are spared from axotomy. These results show that some YFP+ axons begin growing soon after injury (3dpc). Notably, this initial growth appears independent to the presence of CNTF.\n",

      "Second, we observed the growth pattern of YFP+ axons at an intermediate time point. At 3wpc, YFP+ axons in AAV-CNTF-treated animals (CNTF + 3wpc, n = 4 animals) regrew within regions proximal to the lesion site, forming complex branched and looped structures. Some axons also grew past the lesion site (Fig. 4D).\n",
      "\n",
      "To further investigate this complex growth pattern, we examined axon regeneration at six weeks after injury. Optic nerves from four individual animals (6wpc 1–4) are shown in Figure 5. At six weeks postinjury (6wpc), nearly all surviving YFP+ RGC axons were limited to the region proximal to crush site, consistent with the limited ability of CNS axons to regenerate beyond the injury site. We note that the proximal edge of the lesion site occurs at ∼1 mm (±0.2 mm) away from the optic disk. In one animal, we observed one YPF+ axon past the lesion site, elongating to ∼1 mm away from the lesion site (Fig. 5A, 6wpc 4). However, we did not observe regenerating YFP+ RGC axons far beyond the lesion site (i.e., 3 mm from the lesion), indicating that the crush injury was complete and did not leave axons spared.\n",

      "Finally, we examined the response of YFP+ RGC axons six weeks following optic nerve crush when the animals received AAV-CNTF injection.

We injected AAV-CNTF 3 d before unilateral crush, and we collected Thy1-H-YFP mouse optic nerves at six weeks after injury. Injured optic nerves from four individual animals are shown in Figures 6A, 7. Three of the four animals (CNTF + 6wpc 1–3) had axons that could be traced in their entirety.

      "Tracing each axon in its entirety allows comprehensive axon pattern analysis. We observed that axon branching occurs frequently following crush. Approximately half of the axons have 1 or more branches (Fig. 6B, 6wpc). AAV-CNTF significantly increased the number of axons with branches (p < 0.05) and the number of branches per axon (p = 0.0001; Fig. 6B, 6wpc vs CNTF + 6wpc). Next, we sought to characterize for each axon (1) total axon length, (2) how far centrally an axon reached (maximum distance achieved from the optic disk), and (3) how much aberrant growth occurred (aberrant growth = axon total length – maximum distance achieved; Fig. 6C–E). Given that the proximal edge of the crush site is ∼1 mm from the optic disk, we see that most axons in the injury control animals remain within or near the lesion site (i.e., within 0.8–1.2 mm from the optic disk). Surprisingly, even in the absence of growth promoting factors many of these axons grew (Figs. 5B, 6C\n",
      "). This growth was mostly within the region proximal to the crush. Some axons grew between 1 and 2 mm in length. This growth consists of branches and loops, growth that does not extend the axon distally along the optic nerve (Figs. 5B, 6E). Together, these results show that YFP+ RGCs are innately capable of regrowing long axons; however, these axons are unable to successfully traverse the lesion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistent with the regeneration promoting effects of CNTF, axons grew significantly longer than controls (Fig. 6C, p < 0.001). Like the injured control animals, many axons failed to grow through the lesion site, and most regrowth was aberrant (Fig. 6E). In CNTF animals, the axon length measurement shows that despite growing >4–5 mm, some axons are restricted to the lesion area. Independent of treatment, the maximum distance along the optic nerve most growing axons achieve is associated with the lesion site, around 1000 µm from the optic disk (Fig. 6D, distance of lesion site from optic disk indicated as horizontal reference line at 1000 µm). In fact, the median maximum distance achieved by axons in CNTF animals was only 25% longer than that of the control injured animals despite the fact that the CNTF axons grew 3- to 4-fold longer in total length (Fig. 6C–E). Figure 7A shows reconstructed axons of the CNTF + 6wpc 3 optic nerve from different viewing angles. This pattern of regrowth was also evident in the fourth animal (Fig. 7B, CNTF + 6wpc 4). While we were unable to trace each axon from the optic nerve head to termination, we determined that no more than three axons grew beyond the lesion site (Fig. 7B, arrowheads). As shown in the cross view of the optic nerve (Fig. 7, images in the right panels), some axons wrap around the nerve several rounds, further illustrating the extensiveness of tortuous growth.\n",

      "RGCs of different subtypes are connected to distinct presynaptic partners and exhibit an array of responses to visual stimuli. RGCs of different subtypes also project their axons to different brain targets and contribute to image-forming functions as well as non-imaging forming functions (Sanes and Masland, 2015) Anatomically, how do the dendrites and axons of specific RGC types respond to axotomy, as well as after treatments with factors that stimulate axon growth? In the retina, several studies have characterized RGC type-specific changes in dendrite morphology after traumatic axotomy or in glaucoma models. As such, changes in dendrites after insult have been described to some extent. However, the abilities of specific RGC types to regenerate axons and correctly find their targets in adult mammals are just beginning to be determined. Since some studies have shown that many regenerating RGC axons grow circuitously near the lesion and fail to regenerate far, we sought to combine sparse neuronal labeling with iDISCO and follow individual axons derived primarily from one RGC type; αRGC. The major observations in this study are (1) αRGC dendrites decrease their complexity following axotomy, and this response to axotomy is exacerbated by CNTF treatment; (2) YPF+ RGC axons grow over unexpectedly long distances before the lesion site with only a few axons being able to successfully traverse the lesion; and (3) YFP+ axons that do regenerate beyond the lesion site elongate aberrantly, form many collateral axons in the optic nerve and fail to reach the brain.\n",

Together with the observation that αRGCs have higher capacity to regenerate axons compared to other RGCs in general (Watanabe and Fukuda, 2002; Duan et al., 2015), we reason that the majority of YFP+ RGC axons that we analyzed are likely to be of αRGCs. However, because 24% of surviving RGCs are OSPN-negative (i.e., of the 13 surviving YFP+ RGCs per retina, 10 are YFP+/OSPN+ and 3 are YFP+/OSPN−), we are unable to conclusively determine if the axons that grew beyond the lesion site are of αRGC origin.\n",

      "Using transgenic mice that label defined RGC types, previous studies have examined the morphologic changes that occur in RGC dendrites. In a mouse glaucoma model, OFF transient RGCs showed decreased dendritic arborization (Della Santina et al., 2013). Similarly, the dendritic complexity of transient OFF αRGCs from glaucomatous mouse eyes is reduced (El-Danaf and Huberman, 2015). Thus, the results in our study showing loss of dendritic complexity in αRGCs are in line with these previous reports. In contrast, in adult rats, peripheral nerve graft and AAV-CNTF cause an increase in soma size of RGCs without affecting the dendritic complexity or field size (Rodger et al., 2012). However, when examined specifically in the RGC 1 subtype (i.e., RGCs with a large soma), AAV-CNTF caused a significant reduction in the complexity of the dendritic arbors, again without reducing the field size (Rodger et al., 2012). In line with the previous study, our results show that AAV-CNTF leads to a significant decrease in arbor complexity without altering the dendritic field size in most cells. Thus, our results suggest that while αRGC axons are highly regenerative and quite likely generate complex arbors (i.e., in response to CNTF), their dendrites become less complex. In this regard, one could ask why and how does CNTF cause even greater reduction in dendrite complexity in these RGCs? The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying such different behaviors by the axons and dendrites are unknown. It is also unclear whether the reduction in dendrite arbor complexity will be potentially disruptive for the function of these RGCs (i.e., receive less input from their presynaptic partners). These are interesting questions that may deserve further investigation.\n",

      "We observed that the majority of YFP-labeled αRGCs (∼80%) in this experimental example died at six weeks after injury. Currently, it is unclear whether these YFP+ αRGCs die long after injury because of lack of intrinsic survival signals or because they are disconnected for a long time and lack trophic support from the target. It is also possible that they die because they remain unmyelinated (i.e., not remyelinated) for a long period time, lacking the survival signal(s) and other type(s) of support from the oligodendrocytes (or even astrocytes). The question why most RGCs die remains nebulous and justifies further investigation.\n",

      "Several prior studies have adopted tissue clearing strategies and examined axon regeneration in unsectioned, whole CNS tissues (Ertürk et al., 2011; Laskowski and Bradke, 2013; Luo et al., 2013; Pernet et al., 2013; Soderblom et al., 2015). In this study, we sought to expand the 3D analysis to track single axons in given neuronal types. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report the adaptation of sparse labeling and whole tissue staining to attain the entire projection profiles of regenerating axons. Perhaps the most striking observation in our study was the extensive and circuitous regeneration of RGC axons occurring proximal to the lesion site. Axons start to penetrate through the lesion, sometime more than once, but each time they turn back toward the retina and thus they elongate within the proximal optic nerve region (i.e., near the optic nerve head). Additionally, axons that surpass the lesion continue to branch and misroute, with these events lacking an obvious spatial pattern (e.g., occurring near the lesion site). We also note that none of these axons grew past the optic chiasm. As can be seen in Figures 4–7, regenerating axons stop at different distances away from the chiasm. Previous studies have suggested that optic chiasm may inhibit or halt some axons to grow further (Luo et al., 2013; Crair and Mason, 2016). At least for these neurons however, the reason that they fail to grow past the chiasm does not seem to be due to chiasmatic barrier as these axons terminate or turn toward the eye even before they get close to the optic chiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does an axon successfully traverse the lesion? In the CNS lesion, various growth inhibitory molecules are present. Molecular barriers within the lesion area include chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and myelin-associated inhibitors (Yiu and He, 2006). Astrocytes and fibroblasts interact to establish a scar, surrounding the lesion. Therefore, to successfully traverse the lesion, a growing axon will need to modify the extracellular matrix (ECM) and overcome inhibitory/repulsive cues. Differential expression of ECM modifying enzymes and cell surface receptors may explain why some axons never cross the lesion while others do. This simple explanation is challenged by our finding that axons proximal to the lesion form extensive branches and loops and then eventually grow through the lesion (i.e., Fig. 6A, CNTF + 6wpc 1). For this to occur, axons would need to be dynamically responsive to their environment and alter gene expression accordingly (i.e., after failing to traverse the lesion, they change expression of certain molecules to better suit the lesion environment), or crossing the lesion site is a stochastic event. Future investigation will be needed to identify if specific RGCs are can cross the lesion barrier, and what interventions can help axons through this environment.\n",

      "The tracing of individual axons allowed us to measure the total length of individual axons as well as the maximum distances from the eye. Unequivocally, we find that while many axons travel long distances, their circuitous growth results in them remaining within close vicinity to the lesion site. The observation that the regenerating axons grow aberrantly within the optic nerve is mostly in agreement with previous studies (Luo et al., 2013; Pernet et al., 2013). Nonetheless, our current study provides a complete picture of individual axon trajectory, from their entry into the optic nerve to the end of their route. This is particularly the case for the portion of axons located in the proximal area to the injury site which was not possible in the previous studies that have used CTB as a tracer for all RGC axons. Overall, our results build on prior studies and further show that the growth of YFP+ RGCs axons are tortuous in their paths, and that these axons are unlikely to reinnervate their brain targets after CNTF treatment.\n",

      "\n",
      "CNTF is only one of many factors that can induce axon regeneration. Do different regeneration stimulating factors cause a similar degree of aberrant growth and misrouting? Do the axons of all RGC types have similar propensity to misroute? Studies by Lim et al. (2016), and de Lima et al. (2012), showed that at least under certain conditions, some RGC axons are able to regenerate with minimal misrouting and back to their correct targets. In some instances, these RGC axons seem to travel linearly toward the brain (Lim et al., 2016). It appears that under some conditions, RGC axons may be able to navigate through the injured optic nerve. It is unknown what molecular and cellular factors minimize misrouting and produce directed growth within the optic nerve and beyond. It may be interesting to apply 3D analysis and examine the behavior of αRGCs and other RGC types under additional growth-promoting conditions. This could help determine if the aberrant growth seen in the present study is specific to some RGC types or to CNTF treatment per se.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is known that certain types of neurons in different CNS regions including the supraspinal serotonergic neurons are able to spontaneously remodel and reextend axons after axotomy (Hawthorne et al., 2011). On the other hand, other neurons including the corticospinal tract axons are strongly refractory to regeneration where the cut dystrophic axons regress with virtually no signs of regrowth (Thallmair et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2010). In the case of RGCs, we know from studies using CTB tracing that a few of these neurons can spontaneously regrow axons, at least to some short distance into the lesion. The lengthy axons seen even without CNTF in our study indicate that RGCs (and perhaps other CNS neurons) may have much higher growth capacity than generally thought. In the case of peripheral neurons, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons send collaterals and misroute following injury to the central branch (Kerschensteiner et al., 2005). It would be interesting to determine if this aberrant growth of DRG axons is amplified following preconditioning injury, a method to promote regeneration of a DRG’s central branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings highlight the need for prudence when evaluating a growth factor to promote axon regeneration. CNTF and other growth factors are frequently used in regeneration studies to stimulate axon growth. In our study, CNTF produced abundant axon growth, but this growth was highly aberrant. Thus, this growth factor caused “too much of a good thing.” Therefore, future treatments must be adjusted to maximize axon growth into brain targets, and minimize axon branching and tortuous growth.\n",

      "Overall, our study documents the morphologic changes that occur in αRGCs after optic nerve injury. Tracking the entire paths of individual axons reveal that these RGCs can naturally re-extend axons extremely well, but both their inability to traverse the lesion area and their circuitous axon growth limit reconnection with the brain. Our results counter the general view that RGC axons are incapable of lengthy regeneration, and shift the focus from promoting axon elongation, to understanding factors that prevent direct growth of axons through the injured nerve.\n"

      "Health professions education involves training and certifying care‐provider groups in specific procedures. However, there are considerable associated costs that have been estimated globally to amount to more than 80 billion Euros per year.1 Because some training is usually more effective than no training2 but often associated with considerable monetary and time costs, identifying the most cost‐effective strategy can be challenging.3 Nonetheless, many institutions have to balance the need for training new health care providers in performing certain types of procedures against the costs associated with training.4 Cost‐effectiveness analyses are suitable for these types of decisions; however, only a few studies have attempted to link training costs to quality of care.5, 6 Experimental research in medical education provides evidence of effectiveness of different training interventions or programmes.7, 8 However, quite often there are substantial differences in the costs of different training programmes. For example, simulation‐based training may improve learners' anatomical knowledge9 but so does reading a textbook at only a fraction of the cost. Administrators and educators therefore have to question not only if an educational intervention works but also whether the associated change in the outcome of interest is significant enough to justify a difference in training costs.10 Consequently, the ability to inform and guide educators and administrators on future practice is limited unless the associated costs of training are reported and compared in experimental trials. If not, educators and administrators may become reluctant to invest in effective training programmes because the return on investment is not readily apparent.11 Even worse, costly training programmes may be adopted over cheaper but equally effective alternatives as a consequence of lacking cost‐effectiveness data. The discrepancy between how education scientists evaluate training programmes based on their effectiveness and the way administrators determine which programmes to adopt based on cost may eventually lead to a gap between education evidence and actual practice.11, 12\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous studies have attempted to establish the cost‐effectiveness of simulation programmes13, 14 and of different simulator fidelity levels.3 Despite these efforts, there is still no consensus on how to assess cost‐effectiveness in medical education.15 This may in part be attributed to difficulties linking training interventions and patient outcomes.16 Accurate estimation of the total effects of training may also prove challenging due to decay in skills over time, study participant attrition, organisational changes, and residual training effects that remain after the trial period has ended. Moreover, the effects of training are not always immediately apparent but may instead result in better preparation for future learning.17, 18 Likewise, cost estimates are prone to differences between countries, institutions and populations, thus potentially limiting the generalisability of cost‐effectiveness studies in medical education.19\n",
      "\n",
      "The underlying principle of cost‐effectiveness analysis is to compare the difference in costs between training programmes with the difference in effectiveness between the same two alternatives.20 Administrators and educators may only be prepared to pay a certain amount for each unit of the outcome variable. This is also known as willingness to pay (WTP) and is the maximum amount that an administrator is prepared to pay to achieve or avoid a certain outcome. A new programme, intervention or training concept may be considered cost‐effective if the cost of the outcome of interest is less than what administrators are willing to pay.19 Uncertainty is represented in each of the steps described above and probabilistic models have therefore been developed for this purpose in health economics theory21, 22, 23 Using these models, the likelihood that a given intervention is cost‐effective can be calculated and reworded into concrete recommendations to administrators. However, the majority of existing economic evaluations in medical education research3 have failed to include probabilistic analyses, thereby weakening their recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "As indicated above, there are multiple threats to the internal and external validity of cost‐effectiveness research in health professions education. This underlines the need for models that can guide educators, administrators and decision makers in choosing and prioritising training strategies. Based on current health economics theory19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and existing cost‐effectiveness studies in medical education,3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 we propose a general model for conducting cost‐effectiveness studies in health professions education, the Programme Effectiveness and Cost Generalization (PRECOG) model. The PRECOG model includes four steps that represent increasing levels of recommendation strength, from assessment of programme effectiveness and cost to generalisation of cost‐effectiveness evidence. Each step of the PRECOG model is described in further detail in the following sections. In addition, we provide an example of a cost‐effectiveness trial of simulation‐based training in an obstetric emergency unit.\n",

Each step of the model was developed through a synthesis of current health economics theory19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and existing cost‐effectiveness studies in medical education.3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 24\n",

      "\n",
      "The first step includes gathering relevant data on training outcomes of interest. The purpose of this step is to estimate the effect of different training programmes and it follows standard research methods in health professions education. However, special consideration must be given to selection of the primary outcome of interest because it is placed in the denominator of a cost‐effectiveness ratio and any recommendation will be based on potential changes in this outcome. A particular challenge to gathering data on training outcomes is that effects are often measured immediately upon completion of training but may persist long after the study period has ended.25 The true effects of training are therefore underestimated if residual effects are omitted when estimating total training effects.\n",

      "Step 2. Assessing total costs\n",
      "\n",
      "The viewpoint for the cost analysis is rarely reported but is nonetheless important as the cost of training varies depending on who bears it (e.g. patients, hospitals, the national health service, trainees, etc.).19, 26 Existing health professions education literature has reported direct costs in terms of implementation cost,27 equipment cost,3, 13 personnel cost11, 28 and operating costs (e.g. operating theatre costs).28, 29, 30 Unrelated costs that may arise secondary to training are usually not reported. Such costs may involve consequences of ineffective training programmes for future practice (e.g. diagnostic errors or surgical complications). At some point, however, an artificial boundary must be drawn around the cost analyses and the role of unrelated costs is therefore debated in the health economics literature.19\n",

      "Step 3. Determining the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER)\n",
      "\n",
      "When the effects and costs of different interventions have been established, the costs of one additional outcome of interest unit can be calculated as the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER). This ratio can be determined as the ratio of the difference in costs between training programmes to the difference in effectiveness between the same two alternatives.20 An ICER (ICER = ΔC/ΔE) is calculated as the difference in training costs between different training programmes (ΔC) divided by the difference in their effectiveness (ΔE). The resulting ratio is, however, a relative term with no indication of uncertainty and the generalisability of raw cost‐effectiveness ratios may therefore be limited.10\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 4. Estimating cost‐effectiveness probability\n",
      "\n",
      "A new programme, intervention or training concept may be considered cost‐effective if the cost of one additional unit of the outcome of interest is less than the administrator's willingness to pay (WTP) value.21 Willingness to pay is the maximum amount that an administrator is prepared to pay to achieve or avoid a certain outcome. Uncertainty is represented in each of the steps described above and probabilistic models have therefore been developed for this purpose in health economics theory.22, 23 Using an estimate of this uncertainty, the likelihood that a given intervention is cost‐effective can be calculated for different WTP values, which may then be used to provide concrete recommendations to administrators and educators. Uncertainty can be estimated using net benefit regression (NBR) models that take different WTP values, effects and costs into consideration. The basic regression formula for the NBR model can be written as: Net Benefit = WTP × E – C, where E and C are the observed effects and costs, respectively. Based on the variance in distribution of effects and costs, a cost‐effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) can then be generated from the NBR model to provide a graphical illustration of the probability that a training strategy is cost‐effective at different WTP values.19, 22, 23\n",

After completing the simulator training, the participants were trained and assessed by a foetal medicine consultant (LNN).

      "Once training was completed, intervention‐group participants independently performed CLMs on women who presented with symptoms of preterm onset of labour. If participants had a long cervical length (above 25 mm), they could be discharged without consulting an obstetrician. An obstetrician was consulted for further diagnostics or follow‐up if the CLM was shortened (25 mm or less). The control‐group participants provided standard patient care and consulted an obstetrician if a CLM was needed. Over the next 6 months, all study participants recorded each woman's time of arrival and discharge or admission (waiting time; primary outcome), as well as who performed the CLM (midwife, obstetrician, or midwife followed by obstetrician), to determine the number of changes in the responsible health care provider (gaps in continuity of care; secondary outcome). The primary outcome was chosen because managing women with preterm onset of labour is time‐sensitive with regard to initiation of treatment and because we expected considerable psychological stress to be associated with uncertainty for patients during the waiting time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total effects of training were not limited to the first 6 months because the participants continued to perform CLMs after the study period was completed. To account for this residual effect, the estimated number of patients treated by the intervention‐group participants was determined over a 60‐month period via the average number of patients managed per participant per month and the observed participant attrition rate per month. The total number of patients was multiplied by the average reduced waiting time to determine the total number of minutes saved.

      "A template available online for Excel 2011 was used to generate the NBR estimates.35 To determine the distribution of NBR estimates for different WTP values, Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the Cholesky decomposition technique based on observed means and standard deviations for costs and effects for the intervention and control groups. A CEAC was generated based on the Monte Carlo simulations and the NBR model.35 One‐sided confidence intervals were used to assess which strategy was effective for different WTP values.\n",

      "Intervention‐group participants needed a mean 268.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 140.2‒392.2) minutes of simulator training and a mean 7.3 (95% CI, 4.4‒10.3) supervised scans to attain proficiency. Table 1 lists implementation, equipment and total training costs. Patients who were scanned by the intervention group had significantly shorter waiting times (n = 50, mean 80.7 [95% CI 67.4‒93.9] minutes) compared with those managed by the control group (n = 65; mean 117.2 [95% CI 90.5‒144.0] minutes; mean difference between groups, 36.6 [95% CI 7.3‒65.8] minutes; p = 0.008). Gaps in continuity of care were reduced by 84% for patients managed by the intervention group as compared with the control group (16% versus 100%, p < 0.001). The estimated total number of women managed by the intervention group over a 60‐month period was 164, corresponding to a total of 5990 saved minutes (99 hours 50 minutes). The ICER for time saved was EUR 0.45 minute−1 and the ICER for gaps in continuity of care was EUR 19.51/shift. Figure 2 shows the CEAC. For WTP values less than EUR 0.26 minute−1, there was a 95% probability that obstetrician‐performed CLM was the most cost‐effective strategy. For WTP values above EUR 0.73 minute−1, there was a 95% probability that midwife‐performed CLM was the most cost‐effective strategy.\n",

      "\n",
      "We provided a methodological basis for conducting future cost‐effectiveness studies in order to meet the calls for economic evaluations in health professions education.5, 6 We demonstrated a 4‐step model to determine cost effectiveness of training interventions (the PRECOG model). The model included gathering training outcomes, assessing costs, calculating cost‐effectiveness ratios, and estimating the probability that the training strategies were cost‐effective for different willingness to pay values.\n",
      "\n",
      "A substantial challenge for medical education cost‐effectiveness studies is the lack of generalisability of results due to differences in training costs, study context and curriculum design across institutions and countries.3, 19 Systematic reviews and meta‐analyses may overcome some of these limitations, but experimental research in medical education often fail to report costs of training interventions, thereby making economic evaluations across studies difficult. Furthermore, comparisons of effects may be complicated by different evaluation methods, outcome measures6 and follow‐up durations. We proposed a model where the total effects of training were estimated by extrapolating from immediate effects while adjusting for participant attrition rate and skills decay, when applicable. If only immediate effects are taken into account, the costs per unit of the outcome variable may be overestimated. To account for decision uncertainty, we used a probabilistic method for estimating cost‐effectiveness. The importance of conducting this final step was highlighted by both training strategies being recommended as the most cost‐effective in the example provided, depending on administrators' willingness to pay. If administrators were willing to pay more than EUR 0.73 per minute of reduced waiting time, there was a high probability that training a group of midwives in performing CLMs would be cost‐effective. On the other hand, if administrators were willing to pay less than EUR 0.26 per minute, there was a high probability that maintaining the obstetrician‐performed CLMs would be cost‐effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The example used in this study involved training a group of midwives to perform CLMs to reduce patient waiting time before admission or discharge and to reduce gaps in continuity of care. Time is an important parameter when administrating corticosteroids to women with preterm onset of labour36 and gaps in continuity of care are associated with errors during patient handover.37 Both parameters were therefore proxy indicators of care quality. However, we did not attempt to explore their effects on patient outcomes such as neonatal morbidity or number of errors committed during patient handover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths of this study include the use of patient‐level data, a randomised design, standardised protocols for training, assessment and certification, and robust statistical models. There are also some limitations. First, the small sample size and single‐centre design limit generalisability of the study results. Second, only direct effects of the training intervention were assessed and not indirect effects such as reduced and increased workload imposed on obstetricians and midwives, respectively. Third, the equipment costs may have been slightly overestimated in this study as we anticipated that the simulators could not be used for other purposes during the study period. Finally, the model does not provide a one‐size‐fits‐all approach to economic evaluations in medical education, but may be used to improve the methodological rigour of future cost‐effectiveness studies. We chose to select the current model over competing models because it enabled us to link training outcomes to costs and to provide a generalisable estimate of the probability that the intervention was cost‐effective. However, the general principles described in the present model may just as well apply to different methods for estimation of effects, cost, uncertainty and generalisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing evidence of cost‐effectiveness in future experimental medical education trials may bridge the gap between best practice and actual practice.12 Administrators are thereby enabled to prioritise training interventions based on cost‐effectiveness evidence rather than effectiveness evidence alone. However, this requires cost estimates to be reported in future effectiveness studies.\n",

      "Cost‐effectiveness models can be used to link quality of care to training costs. We demonstrated a 4‐step model to determine cost‐effectiveness of training interventions. In the example used in the present study, training midwives to perform cervical length measurements was cost‐effective for WTP values above EUR 0.73 per minute reduced waiting time. Maintaining obstetrician‐performed cervical length measurements was cost‐effective for WTP values below EUR 0.26 per minute waiting time.\n",

      "The transfer of energy and recycling of nutrients via the decomposition of organic matter is a central unifying process that links all organisms to the functioning of ecosystems [1]. However, dead organic matter varies enormously in its spatial and temporal distribution [2], and this determines the magnitude of its contribution to nutrient cycling [3] and the diversity and dynamics of its consumers [4]. Animal carrion is the most nutrient-rich form of dead organic matter [5], and recent reviews have highlighted the overlooked role of carrion in food webs [6], [7], [8], and driving variation in biodiversity and ecological processes in landscapes [5], [9]. Widespread changes to the population dynamics of large vertebrates, through loss of top predators [10] or hunting and harvesting of wild herbivores [11], are affecting the distribution and input of carrion resources in some terrestrial ecosystems [6], [12]. This creates a strong imperative to establish a deeper understanding of the links between carrion, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ephemeral resource patches, such as rotting logs and dung pads, occur in ecosystems worldwide and are focal points of nutrient cycling and aggregation of invertebrates [13], [14]. Carrion is distinct from many other ephemeral resources due to its faster decomposition rate, and its patchy spatial occurrence [9]. This means that carrion has very different spatial and temporal dynamic to other ephemeral resources, and suggests that carrion may have a disproportionate effect on biodiversity and nutrient cycling in ecosystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decomposition of carrion affects its surroundings through pathways to vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers and detritivores, and their predators, as well as through microbial and fungal decomposers and plants. This generates a temporally dynamic patch with high nutrient concentration and biological activity that contrasts strongly with the nearby environment [5], [15]. To date, studies on the effects of carrion on variation in biodiversity have been restricted to single groups of organisms, such as the detailed examination of successional patterns of arthropods [16], [17], and its localised effects on soil nitrogen or plant growth and composition [15], [18]. This has resulted in a detailed understanding of the specialised role that many insect groups have in carrion decomposition, including the critical role of fly larvae [19], [20], [21], and the complex food webs of associated predators and detritivores [16], [22], [23], [24]. Studies on soil and plant responses have demonstrated that the significant spike in soil nitrogen at a carcass can be detected in nearby plant tissue [15], [25], leading to changes in plant growth and composition [18], [26], and is likely moderated by soil microbial activity [5]. Key studies have also shown the importance of carrion for soil nitrogen and plant dynamics across whole ecosystems [27], [28]. Nevertheless, there are only a handful of comprehensive studies that have integrated multiple groups of organisms into the one study design [3], and there are fewer still that have specifically examined the functional traits of different species that respond to carrion. This leaves much to learn about what traits characterise carrion opportunists, and therefore what traits of species can help us understand the links between ephemeral carrion patches and its effect on variation in biodiversity within landscapes [9].\n",
      "\n",
      "We present data from an experiment designed to answer a number of questions about how ephemeral carrion resource patches generates variation in ecological communities. We did this by quantifying the responses of different aspects of the carrion food web, including components of the insect community, soil nutrients, and the plant community. We sought to identify the traits associated with insect responses to the patchiness of carrion, and the responses of plants to subsequent changes in soil nutrients. To do this, we first examined changes in assemblage diversity and composition in response to the experimental addition of animal carcasses. Second, we examined whether assemblage changes corresponded with particular combinations of traits, for both insects and plants. We predicted that insect responses would be associated with their dispersal ability, with specialist species having wing morphologies that enable the rapid location of new carrion resources. We also predicted that plant responses would be associated with their growth potential and ability to exploit elevated soil nutrient levels. Our experiment compared soil, plant and insect responses between paired carrion and control sites with spatial replication. The results of our analysis therefore provide new insight into the magnitude of the spatial contrast between carrion and its immediate surroundings. This allowed us to examine how the spatial contrast changed over time, and how carrion contributes to both spatial and temporal variation in biodiversity and ecological processes within a landscape.\n",

      "\n",
      "In November 2010 (southern hemisphere spring), we added carcasses of kangaroos to 18 sites in temperate Eucalyptus woodland near Canberra, Australia (149°10′ East, 35°10′ South). This study area is part of the Mulligans Flat-Goorooyarroo Woodland Experiment, a long-term ecological restoration project [29]. Specific details on temperature, rainfall, floristic composition and soil types from this study area have been described by McIntyre et al [30]. We sourced carcasses of eighteen eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) over a 10 day period from road kill across the city of Canberra, and positioned them at sites within 12 hours of death. Note that no animals were killed for the purposes of this study. Carcasses were only used when there was not significant blood loss. Average mass of the kangaroos was 31 kg (range 17–80 kg). Each carcass was paired with a control site 10 metres away to allow spatial comparisons between carcass and control treatments through time. We positioned each carcass (and control site) at the base a young Eucalyptus blakelyi tree (<2 m tall at beginning of experiment). Our study area has a history of livestock grazing, resulting in some sites being dominated by exotic grass species [30], [31], [32]. We placed half the carcasses in native-dominated grassland (Themeda sp. and Austrodanthonia sp.) and half in exotic-dominated grassland (Phalaris sp. and Holcus sp.).\n",

      "We took a 4 cm deep soil sample (approximately 4 cm diameter) using a trowel at each carcass and control site at one week (week 0) before carcass addition, and then 12 and 26 weeks after carcass addition. Samples were taken from near the centre of each carcass. Total N content of soil and leaf samples (see below) was quantified with high temperature combustion using a LECA2000 CNS analyser [33]. We performed two analyses of total N, and used the average in our calculations. The potential mineralisable soil nitrogen (organic nitrogen) was quantified using the Illinois soil nitrogen test for amino sugar [34].\n",
      "\n",
      "We took samples of between five and ten leaves from the tips of branches (i.e. active growth zones) in each E. blakelyi tree at carcass and control sites at weeks 12 and 26. No leaves were taken at week 0. Leaf nitrogen content was determined as per soil nitrogen (see above). A higher nitrogen content in leaves indicates potentially greater photosynthetic capacity, and therefore growth potential [35]. Each carcass was positioned on top of existing grasses and forbs, but these were killed off during the early stages of decay. We examined plant re-colonization of carcass patches after 52 weeks by recording the presence of grass and forb species inside a 40×40 cm quadrat at (i) the centre and (ii) edge of each carcass patch, and at (iii) the paired control site. The edge of each carcass was able to be delineated by estimation of the size of the original carcass, and the presence of a ‘halo’ of plant growth. In addition to these standardised quadrats, we also recorded the presence of all other plant species present in the remainder of a 40 cm deep perimeter around each carcass (the ‘surrounding’ vegetation) and the entire carcass patch to compile a complete inventory of grass and forb species. We collected data on plant life forms and specific leaf area (SLA) from the literature [36], [37], [38], and these are summarised in Appendix S2. SLA is the one-sided area of a fresh leaf divided by its dry mass (mm2.mg−1), and is indicative of potential relative growth rate [36]. SLA has also been shown not to vary significantly within plant species [37], thus justifying our use of data from the literature. We used the mean SLA value of each plant species presented in each published account, and excluded rare species for which data were unavailable.\n",

      "Insect Data Collection\n",
      "\n",
      "We sampled insects using a pair of pitfall traps at each carcass and control site. We chose ants and beetles because they are an abundant and diverse components of carrion arthropod communities [3], [16], [39], and yet differ strongly in their dispersal ability and resource use. We recognise that flies are an important part of carrion arthropod communities [16], but we wanted to focus on two diverse groups with contrasting dispersal ability. Many beetles are flight-capable and have high resource specialisation [40], [41], with some specialist species requiring carrion to lay eggs and complete their life cycle. In contrast, ants are generally restricted to the ground (after post-mating dispersal), and may opportunistically scavenge from carcasses or predate on the other insects present. For these reasons, we expected beetles and ants to show very different responses to carrion. Pitfall traps were 9 cm in diameter, and were half filled with glycol solution. The traps were opened for seven days during weeks 1, 6, 12 and 26 of the experiment, which represented distinct stages of decomposition of the carcasses (see Appendix S1). We pooled pitfall trap pairs, giving n = 36 at each sampling time. All insects were extracted from the pitfall traps, stored in 70% ethanol and sorted to order and family. We further sorted beetles and ants to genus and morphospecies using relevant keys [42], [43].\n",

      "Insect Morphological Measurements\n",
      "\n",
      "We measured body length and wing dimensions of each beetle species for comparison of mean trait values of species present at each carcass at control site. We used body length to estimate the body mass of each species of beetle using family-specific length versus weight power relationships for species of Scarabaeidae, Staphylinidae and Carabidae, and a general Coleoptera relationship for all remaining species [44]. We calculated wing loading [45] by dividing body mass by wing area (length x width), expressed as (mg/mm2). We calculated wing aspect ratio by dividing wing length by width, with higher ratios indicating longer and narrower wings [45]. Ant body size is correlated with microhabitat use and resource discovery rates [46], and we regarded this as a useful measure of ant dispersal ability. We measured ant head width and rear femur length, and multiplied these together to calculate a body size index for each species [47]. All morphological measurements were made on up to three individuals of each species (then averaged) using an ocular micrometer with magnification between 10× and 100×, and resolution between 0.1 and 0.01 mm, depending on the measurement and size of the insect. This approach was taken as we were interested in variation in traits between species rather than within species [48].\n",

      "\n",
      "Data Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "We were first interested in quantifying the magnitude of the contrast between carcass and control sites. We used repeated measures linear mixed models in GenStat 14 [49] to test for interactive effects of carcass addition and sampling time on total insect abundance, species richness and evenness, as well as soil and plant nitrogen content. Carcass addition and time were treated as fixed factors, and site as a random factor. We used ANOVA, also in GenStat 14, to test for differences in insect and plant species richness and evenness or traits between carcass and control treatments at a particular sampling time, with blocking by carcass-control pair. Plant SLA was log10 transformed, and insect abundance data were log10(x+1) transformed to meet assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances. Percentage similarity in plant species composition between the edge and centre of carcasses was expressed as the number of shared species divided by the total number (i.e. Jaccard similarity index). We compared similarity between the centre and edge of carcasses because plant recolonisation was more likely to occur from the edge rather than from more distant control sites. We tested for effects of quadrat position (carcass centre, edge or control site) and grassland type (native or exotic) on average SLA across plant species. For this analysis, we excluded rare species that occurred only in one quadrat. We wanted to test whether insect assemblages were more homogenous in composition at carcasses than at control sites due to the widespread dominance of carrion specialists. We used Permutational Analysis of Multivariate Dispersion [50] to test for differences in among-sample heterogeneity of insect species composition between carcass and control treatments, with statistical significance determined from 10 000 permutations of the data. This test calculates the average distance to the centroid of a group of samples projected in multivariate space, with a greater distance to centroid indicating greater among-sample heterogeneity [51]. Multivariate insect abundance data were square-root transformed prior to analysis to reduce the influence of highly abundant species on sample dissimilarity. Shannon evenness was defined as E = H′/lnS, where S is the number of species in a sample, and H′ = −∑ pi ln pi, where pi is the proportion of a species in a sample which is multiplied by the natural logarithm of itself [52].\n",

      "The addition of carrion had significant effects on soil nitrogen (Table 1). The soils in our study environment were originally low in phosphorus and nitrogen compared with grasslands improved for grazing [31], and thus have low productivity potential. The highly concentrated nutrients in each carcass (a 30 kg vertebrate carcass contains approximately one kilogram of nitrogen [5]) produced a dynamic change in soil nitrogen. We found that total soil nitrogen beneath carcasses was 200% higher than control sites after 12 weeks, and 70% higher than control sites after 26 weeks of carrion being added (Fig. 1A). In addition, the concentration of the organic fraction of soil nitrogen was 460% higher than control sites after 12 weeks, and 290% higher after 26 weeks (Fig. 1B). This nutrient pulse also was detected in plant leaf nitrogen levels from nearby tree saplings, which were 18% higher in plants near to carcasses than control sites after 12 weeks (Fig. 1C). This demonstrates the cycling of nitrogen from carcasses into soil, and the uptake and assimilation of soil nitrogen into leaf tissue during the first few weeks of decomposition.\n",

      "Plant recolonisation of carcasses was faster in the exotic-dominated grassland where, after 52 weeks, the composition of plants in the centre of each carcass patch more closely matched the composition of species at the edge of each carcass patch in the exotic-dominated grassland (56% shared species) than in native-dominated grassland (37% shared species). We found a significant interaction between carcass treatment and grassland type (F2 = 11.48, P<0.001) and their effect on plant species richness at carcass patches after 52 weeks. Plant species richness was similar across carcass and control sites in the exotic grassland, but the number of species in the centre of carcass patches in native grassland was only a third that of species at the edge of carcass patches or at control sites (Fig. 2A). This result is further highlighted by our observation that four of the nine native-dominated carcass patches had no re-colonising plants at all, whereas all nine of the exotic-dominated carcass patches had re-colonising plants 52 week after carrion was added (compare Fig. 3A with 3B). The rapid response of plants in the exotic grassland was associated with a significantly higher specific leaf area among the constituent plant species (Fig. 2B, F1 = 18.03, P<0.001). Regardless of grassland type, plants recolonising the centre of carcass patches tended to be annuals rather perennials, and graminoids rather than forbs (Fig. 2C, 2D).\n",

We found that beetle assemblages had a significantly higher species richness and lower evenness during early stages of decay, with a gradual return to levels similar to control sites by week 26 (Fig. 4A, Table 2). This contrasted strongly with ant assemblages, which initially had lower species richness at carcass sites, and did not show the same decrease in evenness as the beetle assemblage (Fig. 4B). We found an overall significant difference in among-sample heterogeneity from carcass and control sites at each sample times for both beetles (F = 21.11, P<0.001) and ants (F = 11.81, P<0.001). However, comparisons between carcass and control sites for each sampling time showed distinctive and contrasting patterns for the beetles and ants (Fig. 5). In the early weeks of decomposition, the composition of beetle assemblages at carrion sites was less variable than at control sites, indicating spatial monopolisation of carcass patches by a few abundant species (Fig. 5A). This changed as decay progressed, with the beetle assemblage becoming more heterogeneous at carrion sites relative to control sites. This was due to widespread species at carcasses becoming less dominant, while assemblages at control sites showed a seasonal decrease in heterogeneity (Fig. 5A). In contrast, there was never a difference in ant assemblage heterogeneity between carcass and control sites (Fig. 5B), with the overall significant difference among groups due a decrease in heterogeneity in week 26 in late autumn. This indicated there was no spatial monopolisation of carcasses by a few ant species, in contrast to that which we observed for beetles.\n",

      "Our results show that carrion in ecosystems represents a dynamic driver of species richness and nutrient cycling. This is supported by our observations, which showed elevated nitrogen in soil and plant leaf tissue at carrion patches, different rates of recolonization by plants, and a diverse and functionally distinct set of insects occurring at carcasses compared with control sites. Importantly, we have shown that the pattern of response by insects and plants was associated with particular functional traits that allow them to respond to and then exploit carrion. This builds on previous work that has demonstrated separately the effects of carrion on soil nutrient heterogeneity [53], scavenger community structure [16], [54], and plant composition [18], and develops further our understanding of how carrion generates spatial and temporal variation in ecological communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found that the nitrogen spike in soils translated into an increase in leaf nitrogen in the nearby E. blakelyi trees, indicating the movement of nutrients from the decomposing carcasses into live plant tissue via the soil subsystem [15], [25]. Trees in the genus Eucalyptus are not nitrogen-fixing and must use available nitrogen in the soil. This suggests that the increase in soil nitrogen due to carcass decomposition was actively taken up by the trees we sampled. The differences we detected in foliage nitrogen between carcass and control sites was smaller than that reported from analogous experimental studies in North America [15], [28], but this may be due to the very different plant species involved, as well as underlying microbial and soil properties. The dramatic change in soil nitrogen also resulted in a greater dominance of grass species with high average specific leaf area. It is well established that these functional plant types typically respond to elevated nitrogen [31]. This reflects observations in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem of North America, where forbs decreased in cover at the centre of ungulate carcasses after 1 year, but grasses increased in cover [18]. This is evidence of in situ organisms displaying trait-dependent responses to new nutrient-rich resource patches. The effects of carcasses on the diversity and composition of ground-layer plant assemblages depended on whether the carcasses were placed in native- or exotic-dominated grassland. Plants at the carcass treatment sites were initially killed by the carcasses due to prolonged shading by carcass remains and rapid soil chemistry changes, but later recolonised from the edges. The quick recolonization of carrion patches by plants in the exotic grassland was largely due to seeding, except for one species that used stolons (Cynodon dactylon). This underlines a context-dependent effect of carrion not previously described at local scales. This parallels a pattern observed for the effects of migrating salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) carcasses on plants in North America, with effects reduced in the more highly productive catchments [27]. Together the results suggest a general principle of context-dependency resulting in temporally attenuated effects of carrion in high productivity ecosystems or in habitats with a high proportion of nutrient-responsive plant species.\n",

      "We showed that dispersal traits of insects were associated with their responses to ephemeral resource opportunities. The distinct dispersal traits of beetles compared with ants was likely to explain, in part, their contrasting dynamics in assemblage composition, and led to their changes in spatial heterogeneity during different stages of carcass decomposition. Dispersal plays a key role in insect spatial diversity patterns [55], and our study provides a further example relevant to carrion. Although carrion affected the relative abundance of ants present in the landscape, it did not affect species richness or spatial heterogeneity. The lack of flight to facilitate rapid foraging means that ants are generally less able to move as rapidly as flight-capable beetles, regardless of any resource specialisation they might have. Although we found that some ant species dominated individual carcasses, such as the meat ant Iridomyrmex purpureus, there were no species that monopolised all the carcasses in the same way some beetle species did. This result is due, in part, to the lack of strong specialisation of ants on carrion resources, with scavenging more likely to be opportunistic. For beetles, capacity for flight and higher wing-aspect ratios were associated with beetles at carrion generally. A larger body size and higher wing loading were important functional traits that were associated with the early colonisation of fresh carrion and spatial monopolisation of this resource. Beetles visiting fresh carcasses were typically equipped with wings that enable manoeuvrable flight [45], suggesting that they can actively seek carrion, and with their large body size have the metabolic capacity to do so over greater distances than smaller beetles. These traits are exemplified by the carrion specialists Ptomaphila lacrysoma and Creophilus erythrocephalus, which are well known to frequent carrion in south-eastern Australia [56], [57]. These species, as well as several others, were not recorded at control sites (Appendix S4), and have not been recorded as part of previous research in the study area [48]. This highlights the unique composition of carrion insect assemblages. Ants at carrion displayed no characteristic morphologies during different stages of carrion decay, and this matched their lack of difference in spatial heterogeneity between carcasses or control sites. Although we focused on morphological traits related to dispersal ability, it is important to point out that the feeding traits of insects are equally important in determining their responses to carrion [16]. For example, the carrion specialists mentioned above also feed on the flesh of carcasses or prey on the insects that do. Their early arrival at a carcass is therefore critical if they are to exploit a resource that will quickly be exhausted. Further research is needed to test if dispersal limitation or small body size actually prevents some species from exploiting carrion, as this would provide a mechanistic link between morphology and assemblage responses to carrion resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, our findings provide an integrated example of how traits of opportunist species in two different taxonomic groups are associated with their ability to exploit patchy and dynamic resources. This adds to the literature on carrion resource specialisation traits and temporal assemblage dynamics [16], [23], to give a fuller picture of the processes that drive spatial changes in species composition. It also supports previous claims that carrion might need to be managed in some ecosystems to maintenance of biodiversity and ecological processes [9], [58]. This includes, for example, the role of carrion in the persistence of dependent insects [59] or the nutrient opportunities it can provide to plants [15]. Our study indicates that appropriate consideration of spatial and temporal continuity in carrion will enable insects of variable dispersal ability to exploit this resource, and will promote spatial heterogeneity in nutrient cycling and plant communities.\n",
