The most important early radiographic sign of stifle OA in dogs with CR is development of synovial effusion and associated compression of the infrapatellar fat pad [1,16].

The increases in serum CXCL8 after BM-MSC injection were not associated with significant changes in synovial CXCL8, although higher synovial CXCL8 was found in the partial CR stifles after intra-articular injection of BM-MSCs. The correlation between serum CXCL8 and CRP became much weaker after BM-MSC injection. Changes in CXCL8 concentrations are likely a consequence of BM-MSC injection, as secretion of CXCL8 and related chemokines is a typical feature of cultured BM-MSCs [36]. In stifle synovial fluid, suppression of IFNγ and IL-6 was also evident after BM-MSC injection. These observations likely reflect the immune-modulatory effects of BM-MSCs on macrophages and T lymphocytes [49,51–54]. Correlation of synovial CCL2 with other cytokines in both stifles was enhanced after BM-MSC injection. Importantly, the pattern of correlation between synovial cytokines was strongly and positively enhanced by BM-MSC injection in the partial CR stifle, suggesting that the MSCs are acting on an upstream master regulator, such as a transcription factor, that influences the cytokine network within the stifle joint environment. At 8 weeks, stifle synovial/serum CRP ratio was higher than at diagnosis in dogs with partial CR that did not experience a second CR, suggesting that additional anti-inflammatory treatment may be needed to augment potential risk reduction second CR [49]. Enhancement of immunomodulation by MSCs could be accomplished in several ways [55–57]. For example, treatment with substance P during culturing of late passage cells could reduce senescence [55]. Use of a three-dimension spheroid culture method for MSCs enhances MSC production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)\n",
